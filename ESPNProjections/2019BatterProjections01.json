Through his age-26 season, Trout had more wins above replacement (64.3) than any player in the history of baseball. Perhaps his trophy shelf isn't as stocked as you'd expect, boasting only a Rookie of the Year and two MVP Awards (though he has finished in the top two in MVP balloting in six of the past seven seasons and never lower than fourth). And yes, he has made trips to the DL in each of the past two years and has yet to appear in more than a single postseason series. These represent nitpicking at its worst, throwing us off from the truth: Trout is a once-in-a-generation talent on the field and in fantasy baseball, worthy of first-pick consideration regardless of format. If his 2017 and '18 injuries -- a 46-day absence from a torn thumb ligament resulting from a slide on a stolen base attempt (2017) and an 18-day absence from a right wrist injury also resulting from a slide on a stolen base attempt (2018) -- concern you, feel free to go a \"safer\" route, but Trout has been the only player in baseball to have been a top-25 overall finisher on the Player Rater and the only hitter to have finished among the top 25 in total points (using ESPN's standard scoring system) in each of the past five seasons.",

How's that for filling every rotisserie column? Betts, in fact, has been the No. 1 hitter on the Player Rater in two of the past three seasons (2016, 2018), and he was the 15th-best hitter in the third season (2017), despite outrageously poor fortune on balls in play, which deflated his batting average to .264. The defending American League MVP, Betts brings a brilliantly balanced package of elite skills: hit tool (never beneath an 82.5 percent contact rate at any professional stop, 50.2 percent Statcast hard hit rate, sixth best among batting-title eligible), power (32 home runs and a 14.1-percent-per-batted-ball Statcast \"barrel\" rate, sixth best among batting-title eligibles), baserunning (at least 26 stolen bases in each of the past three season and a career 83.3 percent success rate), defense (at least 20 defensive runs saved in each of the past three seasons) and arm (26 outfield assists combined from 2016 to '18). He's a viable No. 1 overall pick regardless of format, especially in points-based scoring, where his contact ability represents quite the advantage.",

The result is a perennial MVP candidate, considering he's still only 26, and one who tallied enough time at both second and third base to qualify at both positions in fantasy. While Ramirez's batting average suffered last season, in part due to an increasing fly ball rate (fly balls are among the most likely balls in play to be converted into outs), a .252 batting average on balls in play suggests he has room to rebound in the category. He'll be one of the game's few players with a legitimate chance at top-10 placement in every primary rotisserie category, and his contact ability is especially valuable in points-based scoring, where he was the game's top-scoring hitter in 2018 (by a 35-point margin at that). He's a clear first-round, building-block player in any format.",

He paced all shortstops in home runs in 2018 (38) and was one of only three players with at least 35 home runs and 25 stolen bases (Jose Ramirez, Trevor Story). Lindor's glove is so valuable, he's likely to again rank among the league leaders in games played and plate appearances, boosting his counting numbers and making him one of the few true five-category rotisserie players. He's a surefire first-round pick in all formats but is especially valuable in points-based scoring, where his contact ability could help him repeat his 2018 status as the No. 1 shortstop and No. 3 overall hitter.",

Coming off an absurd .306/.372/.751 hitting line with 31 home runs in 66 games following his July 2017 trade to the Arizona Diamondbacks, Martinez signed a five-year deal with the Boston Red Sox in late February, only to arguably improve his statistics in 2018. He boosted his contact rate by more than three full percentage points and his already-elite hard contact rate by nearly four percentage points, resulting in the fifth-best season using rotisserie scoring and 13th-best using points-based scoring. At 31, Martinez has a skill set that is among the most rock solid of any slugger, as he makes contact nearly three-quarters of the time, makes hard contact roughly 50 percent of the time he puts the ball in play, and possesses the most outstanding all-field power of anyone in baseball, with a league-leading (by an 11-homer margin) 38 home runs to the opposite field the past two seasons combined. He's also a heart-of-the-order hitter in one of the deepest lineups in baseball, meaning he's as good a Triple Crown contender as you'll find. This is a building-block, first-round player.",

Arenado is the only player in baseball to have managed at least 30 home runs, 100 RBIs and .250 isolated power in each of the past four seasons, and he exceeded each of those numbers by a significant amount in all four years. As a Coors Field hitter, though, he exhibits a wide home/road split common to Colorado Rockies players -- his wOBA is 78 points higher at Coors (.419) than on the road (.341) -- mainly relevant because 2019 is his final year before free agency, and if the Rockies don't contend, he could be a midseason trade candidate. Arenado is worth every bit of a first-round pick in any fantasy format, having finished among the top 25 overall on our Player Rater as well as in points-based scoring in each of the past four seasons. As is typical with Rockies, though, he'll be an utterly dominant force at Coors but merely very, very good when away from it. And in the event that he's traded, he might drop back to mere second-round value.",

He has stolen 40-plus bases in each of the past two seasons, and in each of the past three, he has ranked among the game's very best in terms of Statcast's sprint speed, supporting his candidacy for the league lead in the category. Turner also combines a better-than-80-percent career contact rate with an improving eye at the plate and an average of a homer per 32.3 at-bats, things that make him as good a bet for a .280 batting average, 15 homers and 40 steals as anyone in baseball. With the stolen base in decline across the league, Turner is an especially valuable asset in rotisserie leagues, evidenced by his No. 19 finish on the 2018 Player Rater. He's a viable first-round pick there, though in the more sabermetrically oriented leagues that don't weight steals as heavily, such as our standard points-based leagues, he's more of a second- or third-rounder.",

Traded from spacious Marlins Park to homer-friendly Miller Park, he exploded for 36 home runs and league-leading numbers in batting average (.326), slugging percentage (.598), total bases (343) and OPS+ (163), falling just shy of the league's Triple Crown. Don't expect quite the same level of magic this season, though many of Yelich's improvements do say his final 2019 numbers should be closer to 2018's than his output in any of his five seasons in Miami. His major-league-leading home run/fly ball rate -- 22.2 percent using our pitch-tracking tool, 35.0 percent using FanGraphs -- is unsustainable and sure to regress, considering he still hits more than half his balls in play on the ground even with noticeable improvement in that department last year. Even if you shave 5-8 home runs off his 2018 total, he'll still be a viable first-round value across the board thanks to his five-rotisserie-category production, as well as his good plate discipline for points-based leagues.",

He'll inevitably find a home somewhere by Opening Day, and it's good for his fantasy prospects that most of the teams rumored interested call hitter-friendly venues his home, meaning no steep expected drop in any of his rate stats. Machado boosted both his walk (9.9 percent) and contact (83.5 percent) rates to career bests, set another best with .241 isolated power, and didn't show any significant shift in his batted-ball profile in the process. He could also quickly recapture third base eligibility depending upon where he lands, another boon to his value. The No. 21 overall name on the Player Rater and 17th-best in terms of fantasy points in 2018, Machado should again be at minimum a second-round selection in all mixed formats.",

He never seemed quite himself thereafter, slashing .276/.366/.409 in 33 regular-season games and succumbed to mid-October surgery to repair a patella avulsion fracture in the knee. Altuve should be fully healed in time for spring training, and as a soon-to-be-29-year-old (in May), he's close enough to the peak point of a player's typical career curve to expect a rebound, perhaps a significant one. The difficult finish to his 2018, however, served as a reminder that he's probably not quite the 24-homer hitter he was in either 2016 or 2017, nor is he much more than a 30-steal performer at this stage. Once a candidate for one of the first few picks of any draft, Altuve is now more of a second-round type, and a stronger pick in rotisserie leagues, where his multi-category contributions carry greater weight.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Let's first discuss the elephant in the room: An unexpected surgery in mid-January to remove loose bodies from his right elbow could threaten a fully healthy start to Bregman's season. Reports are generally positive that he should be ready for spring training, and everything else points toward his potential superstardom -- both on the diamond and in fantasy baseball. He has shown almost perfect across-the-board growth statistically in every half season in which he has played since his July 25, 2016, big league debut, with his contact rate surging to an extraordinary 85.7 percent after the All-Star break last season. Add to that his well-above-average numbers in terms of average exit velocity (89.2 mph, per Statcast), hard-contact rate (39.8 percent) and fly ball rate (26.6 percent, nearly three percentage points above league average) and there's breakthrough potential for Bregman in batting average and home runs. And remember that his counting numbers should follow, considering the Houston Astros' lineup strength. He might no longer get frequent green lights on the basepaths as he flourishes as a hitter, but hey, we can't have it all. Bregman has legitimate MVP-candidate potential and shouldn't linger very long in any draft.",

Knowing that he has always been one of the game's more successful hitters on the first pitch of the count, Baez swung a major-league-leading 49 percent of the time, representing a 21 percent increase, which almost on its own explains his huge leaps in his traditional rotisserie stats as well as his average exit velocity (89.6 mph) and hard-hit rate (43.2 percent). While he did regress slightly to the mean as the 2018 season progressed as pitchers adjusted to him, he maintained enough of his gains to consider last season closer to his new baseline than the two seasons that preceded it. Baez is always going to be a batting average risk because of his questionable plate discipline, which is something that makes him less attractive in points-based (or sabermetrically driven) scoring -- he was the No. 9 hitter on our Player Rater but only 21st in fantasy points -- but he's a multiposition (second base, third base and shortstop) player whose skills make him a bona fide building-block pick in your draft.",

In what was an overlooked development, he played in 158 games (topped only by his 2017 season) and came to the plate 705 times (a career high), which is promising for a player whose early career was plagued by injuries. Stanton also seemed to click after an initial adjustment to the league change, batting .276/.353/.532 with 33 home runs after May 1 (which prorates to 40 over a full season), so the case can be made he should be better in Yankee Year No. 2. With the injury concerns somewhat quelled, the greatest complaint about Stanton these days is his penchant for strikeouts, though his prodigious power coupled with a solid walk rate makes him every bit as strong in points-based leagues as rotisserie. Remember: It was a year ago that he was picked seventh on average. Have things really changed that much for him? (Answer: No.)",

He was a top-seven major leaguer in batting average (.309, seventh), hits (191, second) and doubles (44, tied for seventh), but saw his home run rate (3.3 percent of his trips to the plate) drop to its lowest since 2014, thanks to a second consecutive season in which his hard-contact rate declined. Barring an unexpected return of an uppercut swing, Freeman's fantasy appeal will center on an extremely high statistical floor and a ceiling that could see him winning the batting title, considering he has now led the majors in line-drive rate in three of the past five seasons (2014, 2016 and 2018) -- he had an extraordinary 30 percent rate in 2018! He should be one of the first picks off your board in any format and one of the first two first basemen, if only because you know exactly what to expect from him.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Acuna's debut campaign, played entirely at age 20, was one for the ages -- and that's saying something, considering how youth-driven this baseball era is. He became only the fourth player age 20 or younger to hit at least 25 home runs while stealing at least 15 bases, joining Orlando Cepeda (1958), Alex Rodriguez (1996) and Mike Trout (2012). Acuna, considered the game's No. 1 prospect at the onset of 2018, might've initially struggled making consistent contact, but his ability to make quick adjustments was a testament to his future superstar potential. From Aug. 1 forward, he whiffed only 21.7 percent of the time and ranked among the majors' top 10 in wOBA (.432, seventh) and slugging percentage (.609, eighth) and among the top 20 in batting average (.320, 17th). Acuna also ranked among the best in the game at making hard contact -- his rate was a stunning 46.6 percent -- and his speed grades also rivaled anyone's beneath the Billy Hamilton/Byron Buxton tier. It might be tough to believe that a 21-year-old with only 111 games' worth of big league experience could be a five-category star, but Acuna fits the \"once-in-a-generation talent\" description that might get him there in 2019. He's one of the first players to roster in dynasty/keeper leagues, a top-25 pick in redraft rotisserie leagues, and he might be ready to elevate his game to that tier in points-based formats as well.",

More likely, the culprit was a slight downturn in performance against fastballs; he hit only .233 against them in the first 54 games, his swinging-strike rate rising by more than three percentage points compared with previous levels, but he almost completely reverted to his former excellence against them the rest of the way -- though for his future prospects, it's worth pointing out that he again collapsed against fastballs in September (.188 average, 13.7 percent swinging strike rate). Now in St. Louis, Goldschmidt could take some time to adjust to new surroundings, or he might enjoy continued tops-at-his-position excellence. Since the humidor did bring Chase Field's park factors closer in line with those at Busch Stadium, don't expect them to be a big obstacle. Goldschmidt is still a building-block, top-25-overall type.",

That's with lowering the bar for qualification last season, however, as he missed 45 team games due to a broken right wrist suffered when he was hit by a Jakob Junis pitch July 26, which was really the only obstacle in his path to an outstanding repeat of his monstrous 2017 rookie campaign outside of natural regression. Asking Judge to repeat 52 home runs was a tall task, and fantasy managers will be smarter with their expectations this time. What they shouldn't overlook when considering his rebound prospects: He improved slightly in terms of his plate discipline, chasing non-strikes nearly 2 percent less often, and he added 69 points of wOBA to his performance against breaking balls (curveballs and sliders) while missing against them more than 2 percent less often. Judge made key adjustments last season, and it's not unthinkable the 2017 version is the one who takes the field in 2019. But even if we split the difference and prorate the stats to a 162-game schedule, he's going to be one of the 25 best assets in rotisserie scoring, and only slightly less valuable than that in points-based leagues (primarily due to his likelihood of striking out 200 times).",

He has been one of the more divisive players in fantasy during his career, however, due to the higher statistical ceilings and lower floors he has exhibited, as well as the injuries that have limited him to an average of 131 games in his six full seasons in the majors. Harper's batting average history alone illustrates his year-over-year inconsistency: He has hit .330, .243, .319 and .249 in the past four seasons, with the most recent (.249) driven by his facing a greater number of defensive shifts. He has some of the best plate discipline in the game, an asset in points-based leagues, and possesses the raw power to contend for a home-run crown, health (and batted ball luck, as his home ballpark isn't yet known) willing, things that could mount a case for a first-round pick. Make no mistake, however: Harper would be one of the riskiest members of that group, if you're so bold to pay that lofty a price.",

One key trait fueled the offensive explosion: He made contact 72 percent of the time after doing so in only 63 percent of his at-bats over the previous two seasons combined. That explained the 52-point increase in his batting average, and accordingly, his 20-steal increase, which was actually supported by an only incremental increase in \"green lights\" compared to either his 2016 or 2017 seasons. Yes, everything Story did last season to improve his game was legitimate, assuming he maintains his contact-rate gains, and if he does so his ceiling could be that of a rotisserie first-rounder. Two things should juuuust hold you back from that level of investment: Questions about the health of his elbow late last year, which, granted, were ruled to be of zero concern after an MRI but still warrant a cautionary glance during spring training; and his still-high K rate coupled with only a so-so walk rate, which makes him a bit less valuable in points-based scoring.",

Benintendi continued to fill every primary rotisserie category without excelling in any one individually. Of most concern: He batted .279/.343/.384 in 57 games after the All-Star break, hitting the ball on the ground 46.5 percent of the time while making hard contact at only a 31.3 percent rate, suggesting further adjustments are required before he truly excels. Benintendi's pro-career scouting reports suggest he could be a five-category star in a short time, and in dynasty/keeper leagues he's worth more of an investment, perhaps a top-20 selection overall. In redraft formats, however, he's not quite building-block material ? at least not unless you're feeling particularly lucky about a quick skills turnaround or see something tangible from him in spring games.",

For the second consecutive year, his launch angle lowered and he hit more balls on the ground, his 44.4 percent rate in the latter category suggesting his true power baseline is that of either 2016 or 2018 and not the year between. Outside of that, not a lot changed for Blackmon, as he filled five categories, remained a top-40-overall points-league performer and was one of the better lefty-against-lefty hitters in the game. His ceiling is probably no longer one that could contend for an MVP award or one of the top spots on the fantasy leaderboards, but he's still worth a building-block, top-30 pick.",

And he did it at the age of 19! Soto is sure to regress slightly as a sophomore, considering his ground ball rate (45.7 percent) doesn't support his power numbers, not to mention Statcast says he overperformed expectations by 26 points of wOBA. Still, his elite plate discipline suggests it'll be minimal, and perhaps nonexistent, with his floor especially high in points-based leagues. Soto is a building-block dynasty/keeper league pick, one of the first players who should come off your board, and he shouldn't last more than a round or two longer in redraft formats.",

Before getting hurt -- accounting only for the season's first two months in this case -- he continued to show growth in terms of his contact and fly ball rates, hinting that his 2016 MVP talent can still be found just beneath the surface. Due to the severity of his injury, which did not require offseason surgery, he'll be one of the players most in need of tracking during spring training. Should Bryant look 100 percent as he claims, he might be one of the year's best bounce-back candidates, capable of top-25-overall fantasy numbers. That's true across all formats, as his improving contact makes him particularly attractive in points leagues.",

Nevertheless, he has been selected amongst the first 16 players in average ESPN drafts in each of the past three years, illustrating fantasy managers' regard for the scouts' \"future MVP\" touts throughout his professional career. Now 25 years of age, Correa needs to convert potential into results, and for the first time, he enters a season with legitimate skills concerns, after his 2018 was marred by back problems, resulting in his hard-contact rate plummeting. Though he's still young enough to reach the lofty goals long forecasted for him, it'd be difficult to pick him in the top 25 overall without first seeing some evidence of complete health, adjustments made or success in spring games. Right now, terming him a breakout candidate requires a leap of faith.",

But his consistency runs deeper than that, as he has ranged between 42 and 48 home runs, 102 and 123 RBIs, 85 and 98 runs scored and an .831 and .874 OPS in his three-year span with the Oakland Athletics. Davis has also slightly improved his fly-ball rate in each of the past two seasons while generating hard contact on roughly half of his batted balls during that same time, cementing his status as one of the favorites to pace the majors in home runs. If there's any complaint to be made, it's that he appeared in only 11 games in the outfield last season, locking him into DH-only status in traditional leagues. His combination of a keen batting eye and prodigious power, however, makes him a top-50 overall asset regardless.",

The return of his power stroke, however, made his 2018 returns all the more significant across all fantasy formats. Thanks to his career-high 20 home runs and .460 slugging percentage, Marte managed a new personal best by scoring the 81st-most fantasy points of any player. His pop might've been somewhat influenced by good fortune on fly balls, but then again, the same thing could've been said about his 2015, meaning that it's not unreasonable to expect him to finish within range of his homer/RBI totals again in 2019. Marte seems to be losing a bit of speed as he ages ? he's now 30 ? so fantasy managers will more than welcome any boost in power. He's one of the more underappreciated five-category options, worthy of a top-30-overall selection in Rotisserie formats, though he's merely an above-average outfielder in points-based mixed leagues.",

There's no shame in that, as these are the metrics of a building-block hitter in points-based leagues and a player who stakes a legitimate claim to the same in Rotisserie. Now check under the hood: Rendon's underlying metrics showed that he might still be improving, albeit slightly, as he posted career bests with a 30.8 percent line-drive rate, .305 expected batting average and .387 expected wOBA (both of those per Statcast) and 44.4 percent hard-hit rate. Even if both his speed and frequency of green lights on the base paths have declined slightly, he's still skilled enough with the bat to at least match his performance of the past two seasons.",

As he did as a rookie, he continued to show a good batting eye, making contact 73.1 percent of the time and walking 13.2 percent, and he had the third-highest fly ball rate among batting title-eligibles (34.6 percent) and 14th-best isolated power (.251). Now back at first base, a much wiser arrangement for him and the Philadelphia Phillies, Hoskins might take a step forward in Year 3, elevating his play to the top 40 in Rotisserie or top 25 in points-based scoring. He's the rare young talent who has pretty sound skills despite the look of a three-true-outcomes type, so don't be afraid to invest.",

Merrifield raised the bar again in 2018, pacing the majors in steals (45) while adding 16 points to his batting average and 22 to his OPS. That's not bad for a player who didn't even register as a top-20 prospect in his own organization entering 2016 by the majority of rankings sources. It's his excellent contact and line-drive abilities that caused him to succeed in spite of scouts overlooking him. In the past two seasons, Merrifield has a 83.4 percent contact rate, which ranks in the game's upper quarter, as well as a 27.2 percent line-drive rate, which is 16th-best amongst 230 hitters with at least 750 plate appearances. Last season, his 8.6 percent walk rate was his best in any single professional season since he was in Class A+ ball in 2012. He's a high-floor player with a solid on-base percentage to fuel stolen-base opportunities, making him a strong bet to again rank as one of the 25-40 best options in Rotisserie leagues. Merrifield also isn't a bad points-league choice, having finished among the top 60 in the game in fantasy points in each of the past two years.",

For example, during the Chicago Cubs' first 40 games last season, he batted just .195/.301/.358, which mostly explains his \"down\" performance compared to the four years that preceded it. If that causes him to be underpriced in your league as a result, swoop in, because during the team's next 123 games ? the most recent ones and therefore those more relevant for our purposes ? he batted .307/.397/.501, which is really not a far cry from his .282/.385/.512 rates from 2014-18 combined. Rizzo's slipping hard-contact rate hints that he might struggle from this point to consistently reach the 30-homer plateau, but now we're just nitpicking. He was a top-40 points-league player and 75th in Rotisserie last season. He probably has room to rebound and there's little doubt he should at least meet those finishes again in 2019.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Bellinger's young, one-and-seven-eighth seasons' big-league career has been one of peaks, valleys and frequent need for adjustments (both for him and for opposing pitchers). Who remembers his .219/.254/453 postseason performance in 2017 that concluded with him not recording a single base hit (playoffs included) against pitches thrown \"down and in\" from Sept. 1 forward? How about his 24 home runs in his first 57 big-league games, a major league record? What you might not have seen so easily were Bellinger's shifts toward greater contact and more line drives, especially after the All-Star break last season, when he batted .285/.369/.453 with 72.9 percent contact and 28 percent line-drive rates. This coincided with a collapse against left-handed pitchers during that same time span, as he batted just .233 with a .041 isolated power against lefties. He might not be quite the all-or-nothing, extreme-streak type player he was as a rookie, but he also might no longer be the potential home run champion he once was. Bellinger is still adjusting, so a top-25 season isn't completely out of the question, but don't make the mistake of assuming he's already there. That's especially true in points-based leagues, where his past strikeout history is a bit more of a problem.",

He has scored at least 100 runs in each of the past three seasons, making him one of four players who can claim that, though that's partly the product of his being a leadoff man for one of the game's best offenses. Springer is a very good player, however, having averaged 28 home runs and 79 RBIs the past three years behind .269/.357/.470 triple-slash rates, but it's a concern that his ground ball, hard-contact and baserunning metrics seem to be going in the wrong direction. To the latter point, his 48.8 percent success rate on stolen base attempts in that time was worst in the majors (minimum 20 attempts), so the Astros might not be as apt to grant him green lights, taking away an important part of his fantasy game. Springer probably has a mini-rebound left in him, but he's better regarded as a top-50 overall pick than as a true building block.",

Offseason surgery should've cured the shoulder issue, but he wasn't going to repeat the .312-37-124 numbers he enjoyed in 2017 anyway, so the question becomes how much of a rebound can we expect? Do we split 2017 and 2018 down the middle? Perhaps, though Ozuna's 81.1 percent contact rate last season set a professional best for him, and he lost practically nothing from his hard-contact rate, which means a substantial rebound isn't out of the question. This is also a beefed-up Cardinals offense entering 2019, so the counting numbers could be plentiful. Don't let this guy slip too far in your draft.",

Last season, he boosted his hard-contact rate substantially, adding more than 13 percentage points to it, and he lowered his ground ball rate for the third consecutive year, resulting in personal bests in home runs (34), RBIs (104), slugging percentage (.526), isolated power (.243) and batting average (.283). Still, Suarez took a step backward after the All-Star break last season, slashing .245/.322/.463, which made it seem like last season was probably his statistical ceiling. He was a top-75 overall player regardless of format, though, and should be a good bet to reach that status again in 2019.",

In a most encouraging development for his possibly repeating the effort, he added 45 doubles, which has him on the fringe of being a true superstar using points-based scoring. Don't mistake Bogearts for a burgeoning power hitter, though, as he's still more line-drive- than fly-ball-oriented, with batting average and RBIs still his strongest categories. He's a surefire top-10 fantasy shortstop, and that's saying something, considering how much deeper the position has gotten in recent years.",

Remarkably, though, he has never batted as high as .300 or hit as many as 30 home runs in any of his six big league seasons, nor has he ever been a top-50 fantasy player (Rotisserie or points-based scoring) in a full season. Castellanos sure looks like a player who belongs in that valuation tier, but the rebuilding Detroit Tigers team around him will prove a hindrance to his counting numbers -- RBIs and runs scored, as well as plate appearances to a degree as the team struggles to roll over the lineup ? and make the climb continually difficult. Be intrigued, but be realistic.",

He boosted his walk rate to 10.2 percent and excelled especially on the road, where he slashed .307/.377/.537 while maintaining good enough speed to chip in eight stolen bases. Haniger returns as an everyday player in 2019, but on a much weaker Mariners team, which means his counting numbers (runs, RBIs and perhaps plate appearances) might be the most likely to regress. He's plenty capable of another 25-plus homers and .280-plus batting average, however, and he remains well worthy of top-50 status regardless of format.",

He became only the 21st rookie in history with at least 20 home runs, .200 isolated power and a 110 OPS+, with the primary blemish on his record his forgettable .229/.290/.349 rates during the New York Yankees' final 25 regular-season games. Those were forgivable considering his age and limited experience, and Torres could be ready to take another step forward as a sophomore. An added bonus: He might pick up shortstop eligibility quickly, should the Yankees find they need him to fill in for the injured Didi Gregorius (and soon-to-be-injured replacement Troy Tulowitzki). Torres' power makes him a building-block pick in dynasty/keeper leagues, perhaps among the top 25 overall, and in redraft leagues he's an early-to-mid-rounder. He's a little less appealing in points-based league, though, due to a relatively high strikeout rate.",

Worse yet, while he had shown consistent growth in terms of his launch angle, exit velocity and fly ball rate through the 2018 All-Star break, he seemed to give back many of the gains thereafter, which causes concern that he has tapped out any upside. A shoulder issue did bother him briefly in June, however, and his season ended prematurely due to a quadriceps injury, so it's possible that the injuries are a more logical explanation for the downturn in stats. Rosario's contact and power skills are probably better than you think they are, and the high fence in Minnesota's Target Field has not been nearly the hindrance you would assume. It's not unthinkable that he'll take another small step forward if fully healthy at the start of spring training, but even if he spins his wheels, he'll be a top-25 outfielder and top-75 player overall, regardless of fantasy scoring system.",

The difference in the composition of the major league baseball is a possible explanation, but it's just as likely that Albies enjoyed rather good fortune on batted balls during the season's first third, as he hit 14 of his 24 home runs in the Atlanta Braves' first 54 team games behind a mere 4 percent drop in his ground ball rate. Albies' finish to the season was much more forgettable: .254 batting average, 10 home runs, eight stolen bases, 57 runs scored. Those weren't even top-150 overall numbers in Rotisserie leagues. For Albies to repeat or exceed his 2018, which was a top-75 season on the Player Rater and top-60 using points-based scoring, he'll need the return of the patience he exhibited in his minor league career as well as a stronger performance against right-handed pitching. He's only 22 years old, so growth is a distinct possibility, but because he's still making adjustments, he's a wiser pick as a borderline top-50 player than something more.",

Last season, Vlad Jr. was the minor-league leader in batting average (.381), slugging percentage (.636), OPS (1.073) and wRC+ (194), with most of that production coming in Double- and Triple-A. Many argued that he would've thrived in the big leagues last year, ? la Ronald Acuna Jr. and Juan Soto, had he been promoted, and there has been little disagreement that he'll be a star the instant he sets foot on a big-league diamond in 2019. Guerrero could hit for elite batting average and power immediately, with the main obstacle to fantasy success this year being the Toronto Blue Jays' decision of when to promote him. He's a player who shouldn't linger far beyond the top 40 picks regardless of format, and in a dynasty/keeper league, he's building-block material.",

He has averaged annual .308/.353/.449 triple-slash rates, 14 home runs and 25 stolen bases in that time span, never varying by more than 11 points of batting average, six homers or eight steals in any single year, and he has averaged Nos. 46 and 84 annual finishes on the Player Rater and in fantasy points. Now the Philadelphia Phillies' starting shortstop and likely leadoff man, he could enjoy a small uptick in pop in one of the game's friendliest home-run environments, which could offset any possible loss of stolen base chances on a more analytically minded team. Segura should again be a top-10 shortstop in any scoring system, and he is a reliable early-round pick.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Votto is coming off the worst \"healthy\" (read: 100-plus games played) season of his 12 in the bank, having hit only 12 home runs with .135 isolated power and a .284 batting average. The fact that he's now 35 years old might have fantasy managers guessing he's in the waning years of his career. Looking more closely, though, he was extraordinary unlucky when he put the ball in play. His 9.0 home run/fly ball percentage was nearly 4 full percentage points beneath his career number (12.9 percent), and his .647 batting average on line drives was roughly 75 points beneath his career mark. That is significant when you consider that he ranked second in the majors with a 34.3 percent line-drive rate and showed only a minimal decline in quality of contact. Votto probably has a lot of room to rebound, even if his MVP-caliber days are behind him, and he's going to be a potentially huge bargain in points-based leagues if he sneaks outside the top 40-50 picks. Be aware that he finished 94th in fantasy points in that disappointing 2018. He shouldn't last more than a couple rounds longer in Rotisserie formats, either.",

All indications are that he should be fine for spring training, but after a year off, he might take some time to recapture the form that made him a viable candidate for .290-25 numbers from the shortstop position. Seager seemed to be elevating the ball and striking it with more authority as a sophomore in 2017, so there's still a lot to like here from a long-term (read: dynasty/keeper leagues) perspective, but he's one of the most important players to track during spring training after all the time off. He's a top-10-capable fantasy shortstop in any format, but considering his long road back from surgeries, he's the kind of player with whom you'll need to be patient if he struggles in the season's early weeks.",

Those concerns were quickly allayed, though, as he slashed .278/.394/.580 and hit 32 home runs in his next 112 games played, performing as a top-15-overall player in Rotisserie leagues while scoring the fifth-most fantasy points of any hitter during that time. As had been the case throughout his big league career, he continued to exhibit one of the most polished plate approaches of anyone while ranking among the league's leaders in fly ball rate, but most importantly, he posted a career-best 44.4 percent hard contact rate, which supported his power growth. While it's dangerous to extrapolate 70 percent of a season over a full year, Carpenter has the skills to do it, and he possesses one of the higher statistical floors of any player. He's an especially attractive pick in points-based leagues, in which he's a virtual lock for a top-50 season, but he shouldn't linger much longer than that in a Rotisserie draft, either.",

At 38, he's one of those players who has aged gracefully, but don't make the mistake of interpreting that as his not aging, as his ground ball rate has been inching upward at the expense of his line-drive rate, and he posted mere .242/.314/.472 second-half rates last year. Cruz is more likely to see his numbers decline than improve despite the ballpark swap, and he's DH-only in fantasy leagues this year, with little chance of that changing in-season. He remains worthy of an early-round pick but shouldn't go until all of the clear building-block types are off the board.",

        "seasonOutlook": "Although he never reached the lofty MVP predictions the scouts bandied about at the time of his big league debut, Upton has quietly become one of the most consistently good outfielders in fantasy over the past half-decade. He has averaged .259/.339/.483 triple-slash rates, 30 home runs, 93 RBIs and 85 runs scored in that time, never straying more than 14 batting average points, five home runs, 16 RBIs or 15 runs scored from those marks in any year. Of concern, however, is that Upton's ground ball rate rose slightly and his stolen base and doubles totals declined significantly last season, hints that he might be entering the decline phase of his career at age 31 -- or, at least, it's coming soon. His penchant for strikeouts makes him a much riskier pick in the early rounds of points-based leagues than Rotisserie, in which he's still capable of being a top-25 outfielder and top-100 player overall.",

He underwent abdominal surgery, then an infection cost him the final two weeks. Even when he did play, Abreu's .798 OPS was a career low. The good news is all of Abreu's underlying metrics, most notably Statcast data and contact rate, were in line with previous seasons, suggesting his career-worst .294 BABIP was more fluke than fact. As such, look for a rebound campaign from Abreu with a solid floor. Given Abreu's health and defensive shortcomings, the White Sox are planning to use him more often as their designated hitter in 2019 and split the first base and designated hitter duties between Abreu and Yonder Alonso. That should provide enough playing time for Abreu to retain first-base eligibility at least one more season.",

        "seasonOutlook": "The Brewers' investment in Cain paid huge dividends in Year 1, as he posted a career-high OBP (.395) and racked up 30 steals for the first time as a big leaguer. Setting the table in a strong lineup, Cain was a very productive four-category contributor, and he'll reprise the same role for Milwaukee in 2019. The only wart in his approach was a spike in ground balls, as he surged to a 54.6 ground ball rate after sitting with a 44.4 percent mark in 2018 (career 48.2 percent). However, that increase was accompanied by a well-balanced spray chart, as he went the opposite way more often (32.9 percent of the time). Cain will turn 33 in April, and a growing history of soft-tissue injuries with his legs presents some durability concerns, making it more likely that he finishes closer to 600 plate appearances than 700, but his skill set appears to be stable across the board.

Predictably, he struggled in the early weeks of 2018 as he worked back to full strength, but it was his finish that bodes so well for 2019: He batted .273/.356/.539 with 17 home runs and 52 RBIs in 68 second-half games, resulting in his finishing the year with more homers (28) than he had in his breakthrough 2017 (27). Conforto did plenty to put his career back on the track to superstardom, and if he has a strong spring, he might wind up one of the most buzz-worthy players of late-spring drafts, perhaps staking a claim to a top-50-overall selection. He's well worth an early-round pick.",
