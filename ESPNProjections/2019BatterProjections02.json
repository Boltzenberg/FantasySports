That might well explain the streaky periods during his brief big league career to date, such as the .164/.210/.261 36-game stretch he endured from May 20 to June 30 of last season, and it makes his end-of-season numbers in each of the past two years extraordinarily impressive in retrospect. Most encouraging for Pham's future potential was his strong finish following a midseason trade to the Tampa Bay Rays, with whom he batted .343/.448/.622 with seven home runs and five stolen bases in 39 games, restoring the power/speed combination that made him one of 2017's biggest breakthrough stories. Pham should bring that style of play back in 2019. He is a good two-to-four rounds more valuable in a Rotisserie than points-based league, but he's well worth an early-round pick in either.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":505.0,"1":135.0,"2":0.267326733,"3":20.0,"4":5.0,"5":23.0,"6":48.0,"7":87.0,"8":234.0,"9":0.463366337,"10":71.0,"11":1.0,"12":7.0,"13":4.0,"14":7.0,"15":3.0,"16":588.0,"17":0.362244898,"18":0.825611235,"19":0.0,"20":99.0,"21":68.0,"22":0.0,"23":18.0,"24":8.0,"25":10.0,"26":21.0,"27":151.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":150.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":6,"statCategoryRanking":38,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":1.1325969},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":1.270104},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":2.2789164},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":1.0442487},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":1.6834735}],"totalRanking":62,"totalRating":7.4093394}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":30699,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":8,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":14,"rank":77,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[9,5,12,16,17],"firstName":"A.J.","fullName":"A.J.

When healthy, Pollock has been one of the better five-category performers around baseball, averaging .286-20-68 numbers with 28 stolen bases and 93 runs scored per 162 team games for which he was active from 2014 through 2018. Unfortunately, he has missed a whopping 36 percent of his team's games during that five-year span, making four separate trips to the disabled list, each at least 43 missed games in length. Pollock's move to Los Angeles shouldn't change things dramatically for him, considering Chase Field's humidor brought its park factors closer to those at Dodger Stadium. He also enjoyed career highs with 21 home runs and .228 isolated power in 2018, hinting that there might be more power growth yet to come, a welcome sight considering that he seems to be gradually slowing on the base paths as he enters his age-31 season. Pollock would be a top-20 overall player if we could trust he'd stay on the field, but the risk of additional absences should keep him a few rounds below that tier.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":519.0,"1":137.0,"2":0.263969171,"3":29.0,"4":4.0,"5":23.0,"6":56.0,"7":81.0,"8":243.0,"9":0.468208092,"10":37.0,"11":2.0,"12":9.0,"13":6.0,"14":7.0,"15":1.0,"16":572.0,"17":0.31993007,"18":0.788138162,"19":0.0,"20":77.0,"21":72.0,"22":0.0,"23":19.0,"24":5.0,"25":14.0,"26":8.0,"27":114.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":141.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":10,"statCategoryRanking":87,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":0.20206478},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":1.270104},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":0.90250725},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":1.1126472},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":1.3793277}],"totalRanking":142,"totalRating":4.8666506}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":33743,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":5,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":14,"rank":80,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[3,7,19,12,16,17],"firstName":"Miguel","fullName":"Miguel Andujar","id":33743,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"41","lastName":"Andujar","lastNewsDate":1539090398000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":10.142857142857142,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":85.0300925925926,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":93.02325581395348,"percentStarted":86.82170542635659},"proTeamId":10,"seasonOutlook":"An injury to Brandon Drury in the season's opening weeks paved the way for Andujar to take over the hot corner in New York, and he flourished when granted the regular opportunity.

Andujar, 24 years old, is now a locked in member of the New York Yankees' lineup, despite the fact that trade rumors swirled around him for much of the winter, giving him an additional chance to up his power output as a sophomore. He's probably due for some regression after such a successful rookie campaign, but there are many paths to a top-50 fantasy season ahead of him.

After returning to action in the first half of June, he struggled to produce at the levels he sustained during his first two seasons with the Nats, despite maintaining a low strikeout rate (11.4 percent) and a similar batted-ball profile to his previous three seasons. A midsummer trade to the Cubs preceded an uptick in power, as he slugged .471 over his final 35 games while hitting six of his 12 homers during that span. Murphy signed with the Rockies as a free agent in December, where he'll be a fixture on the right side of the infield on a daily basis and have a very clear path to compete for an NL batting title as a hitter who was capable of winning one even without the benefit of playing half of his games at Coors Field. With full health through the offseason and a power boost from his new home park, Murphy should push his way back to the 20-25 homer range with ease.

Shoulder surgery (November 2015) and ankle issues leading to another surgery (October 2017) didn't seem to take anything away from him last year, as his 30.9 percent line-drive rate was ninth-best in the majors and represented the 10th consecutive year he posted better than a 20 percent rate. He also posted an 89.5 percent contact rate that was better than his career rate of 88.2 percent. Now in Houston, Brantley's batting-average-oriented game probably won't change, though his so-so power metrics imply a boost in power is much less likely there than in Cleveland.

He slipped into his old habits shortly thereafter, though, as from June 1 onward, he walked only 3.3 percent of the time, batted .235/.266/.376, hit nine home runs and was 14-of-21 stealing bases. Simply put, Anderson's free-swinging ways make him wildly inconsistent, a batting average risk and a poor choice to bat atop any lineup, with the combination of those putting a cap on his stolen base potential.

Anderson is also one of the more overrated players using points-based scoring, having finished roughly 100 rankings spots lower in that format each of the past two seasons, making him only marginally draft-worthy in traditional mixed leagues.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":578.0,"1":144.0,"2":0.249134948,"3":28.0,"4":4.0,"5":18.0,"6":50.0,"7":94.0,"8":234.0,"9":0.404844291,"10":25.0,"11":1.0,"12":4.0,"13":2.0,"14":5.0,"15":3.0,"16":612.0,"17":0.282679739,"18":0.687524029,"19":0.0,"20":77.0,"21":58.0,"22":0.0,"23":21.0,"24":6.0,"25":15.0,"26":13.0,"27":156.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":149.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":11,"statCategoryRanking":50,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.6421205},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":1.1655132},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":1.4396425},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":1.0784479},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":3.356275}],"totalRanking":89,"totalRating":6.3977585}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":32132,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":3,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":13,"rank":86,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[1,7,19,12,16,17],"firstName":"Jesus","fullName":"Jesus Aguilar","id":32132,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"24","lastName":"Aguilar","lastNewsDate":1538342581000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":8.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":95.27146171693735,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":92.62135922330097,"percentStarted":86.2135922330097},"proTeamId":8,"seasonOutlook":"Aguilar's was the 2018 breakthrough we all should've seen coming ? though the fact that practically none of us did is understandable considering the Milwaukee Brewers' glut of first base/outfield types entering the year.

After his return in August, he looked like the budding superstar he was entering the year, batting .357/.449/.618 with nine home runs and 32 RBIs in his final 53 regular-season games and rating as one of the 20 best players using Rotisserie scoring and one of the five best hitters in fantasy points scored in that time. That makes Turner look like more of a risk/reward pick than anything, a label that makes some sense considering his 34 years of age.

Consider this: He was the No. 1 overall catcher using both rotisserie and points-based scoring in 2018, and by a significant margin in the former, despite playing for a team that scored just 589 runs. The Phillies provide him more lineup support, meaning more plate appearances, runs and RBIs even if he moves down a couple spots in the order, and he moved from the game's worst home run environment for right-handed hitters to one of its best. Realmuto, who enters the year a prime-age 27, has boosted his walk rate in every one of his five big-league seasons, posted a professional-best .208 isolated power in 2018, and backed the latter up with sizable increases to both his launch angle and hard-contact rate. The only real debate here is when to select him in drafts, considering how poor the overall catching pool, as he'll be a near-unanimous top pick at the position. In an ESPN standard league, that could still be worth a top-75 overall pick, but in those that use two catchers or points-based scoring, he definitely belongs in that tier.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":489.0,"1":138.0,"2":0.282208589,"3":29.0,"4":3.0,"5":23.0,"6":55.0,"7":83.0,"8":242.0,"9":0.494887526,"10":34.0,"11":1.0,"12":7.0,"13":3.0,"14":3.0,"15":0.0,"16":533.0,"17":0.335834897,"18":0.830722422,"19":0.0,"20":77.0,"21":74.0,"22":0.0,"23":6.0,"24":2.0,"25":4.0,"26":8.0,"27":107.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":128.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":1,"statCategoryRanking":83,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":1.1687306},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":1.270104},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":1.3389297},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":1.4204401},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.1414011}],"totalRanking":134,"totalRating":5.056803}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":5904,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":3,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":12,"rank":94,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[1,7,19,12,16,17,11],"firstName":"Edwin","fullName":"Edwin Encarnacion","id":5904,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"10","lastName":"Encarnacion","lastNewsDate":1544693053000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":7.285714285714286,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":102.14351851851852,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":89.14728682170542,"percentStarted":83.13953488372093},"proTeamId":12,"seasonOutlook":"Encarnacion has been one of the most consistently elite power hitters in baseball for nearly a decade now, as he is the only player in the game to have hit at least 30 home runs in each of the past seven seasons, and he is the major league leader (by nine) in the category in those seven years. Unfortunately, as a 36-year-old who was traded to the Seattle Mariners in the offseason, he's a riskier pick this year than he has been in the recent past. His contact rate has steadily dropped during the past half-decade, and his supporting cast is considerably weaker entering 2019, negatively influencing his runs and RBIs (and perhaps his plate appearances). Encarnacion might have one more top-100 season left in him, one that's generally slightly more valuable in points-based than Rotisserie scoring, but he's no longer a building-block player you want in the early rounds of your draft.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":553.0,"1":132.0,"2":0.238698011,"3":19.0,"4":1.0,"5":38.0,"6":58.0,"7":74.0,"8":267.0,"9":0.482820976,"10":76.0,"11":2.0,"12":6.0,"13":6.0,"14":6.0,"15":0.0,"16":641.0,"17":0.333853354,"18":0.816674331,"19":0.0,"20":81.0,"21":106.0,"22":0.0,"23":2.0,"24":0.0,"25":2.0,"26":14.0,"27":143.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":150.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":7,"statCategoryRanking":61,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.28371927},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":2.420604},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":1.3389297},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":2.549014},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.1414011}],"totalRanking":105,"totalRating":5.883427}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":31265,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":5,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":12,"rank":95,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[3,7,19,8,5,12,16,17],"firstName":"Wil","fullName":"Wil Myers","id":31265,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"4","lastName":"Myers","lastNewsDate":1547288706000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":6.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":115.30394431554524,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":88.54368932038835,"percentStarted":83.88349514563107},"proTeamId":25,"seasonOutlook":"After back-to-back seasons with at least 155 games played, Myers struggled to stay healthy in 2018, losing nearly half of his season to a nerve injury in his arm, a bone bruise in his foot and an oblique strain. The addition of Eric Hosmer pushed Myers back to the outfield, but the Padres shifted Myers to third base for the final two months of the season. While he has the athleticism necessary to make the transition a successful one, he's still a work in progress at the position. At the plate, Myers' power dipped slightly (.446 SLG), but it's easy to write that off as a by-product of health. If he continues to strike out at a 27 percent clip, his batting average ceiling will likely be capped in the .250-.260 range. But he'll have a favorable spot in the San Diego lineup, and his combination of power and speed should give him a path to another 20-20 season.

The midseason addition of Mike Moustakas pushed Shaw over to second base on a semi-regular basis late in the season, and he managed to hold his own at the position. More importantly, he played in enough games to add positional eligibility at the keystone for 2019. Although he maintained the power gains from the previous season, Shaw's RBI total and runs scored output took a slight hit, but that might have been the byproduct of having NL MVP Christian Yelich frequently clearing the bases ahead of him. Shaw's plate discipline was better than ever last season, as he walked 13.3 percent of the time and struck out in 18.4 percent of his plate appearances, but he was more pull-happy than ever, which made him a slight batting average liability. Shaw will likely hold a similar role for the Brewers in 2019, getting the bulk of the starts at third base, and holding down the fourth or fifth spot in the lineup most days.

Dahl is a potentially hype-worthy player, thanks to his combination of power and speed, as he has averaged 22 home runs and 26 stolen bases per 162 games played during his professional career. Summoned to the majors probably for good on Aug. 5, he started 39 and appeared in 45 of 53 regular-season Rockies games, batting .272/.333/.563 with 12 home runs, 35 RBIs and three steals. Dahl could enter the season in a platoon, perhaps with light-hitting Noel Cuevas, but he did slug .438 against lefties in the majors last season, providing him a legitimate path to a regular role and with it breakthrough possibilities. If he's shaping up as said regular during spring training, a top-100 overall pick in Rotisserie leagues isn't unreasonable. Dahl will be at least a few rounds less attractive than that using points-based scoring, though, due to his so-so plate discipline.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":510.0,"1":146.0,"2":0.28627451,"3":30.0,"4":8.0,"5":24.0,"6":62.0,"7":84.0,"8":264.0,"9":0.517647059,"10":36.0,"11":4.0,"12":3.0,"13":3.0,"14":6.0,"15":3.0,"16":553.0,"17":0.334538879,"18":0.852185938,"19":0.0,"20":67.0,"21":77.0,"22":0.0,"23":12.0,"24":6.0,"25":6.0,"26":9.0,"27":132.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":140.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":27,"statCategoryRanking":173,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":0.5791571},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":0.74714947},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.10462145},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.5312605},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":0.16274466}],"totalRanking":328,"totalRating":1.9156903}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":32767,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":3,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":12,"rank":100,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[1,7,19,12,16,17],"firstName":"Matt","fullName":"Matt Olson","id":32767,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"28","lastName":"Olson","lastNewsDate":1538234002000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":6.428571428571429,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":123.55787037037037,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":87.79069767441861,"percentStarted":78.10077519379846},"proTeamId":11,"seasonOutlook":"Olson's unsustainable home run rate of 2017 predictably regressed in his sophomore/first full big league season in 2018, but might they have swung too far in the opposite direction?

Keep tabs on that in the spring, as it could mean the difference between his challenging for top-25 outfielder status and merely hovering at the back end of the top 40.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":565.0,"1":144.0,"2":0.254867257,"3":27.0,"4":2.0,"5":27.0,"6":56.0,"7":88.0,"8":256.0,"9":0.453097345,"10":80.0,"11":2.0,"12":8.0,"13":5.0,"14":6.0,"15":1.0,"16":659.0,"17":0.352048558,"18":0.805145904,"19":0.0,"20":85.0,"21":75.0,"22":0.0,"23":11.0,"24":7.0,"25":4.0,"26":10.0,"27":149.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":152.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":11,"statCategoryRanking":69,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":0.16178583},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":1.1655132},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":1.6410682},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":1.1126472},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":1.5314006}],"totalRanking":115,"totalRating":5.612415}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":31253,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":8,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":11,"rank":106,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[9,5,12,16,17],"firstName":"Aaron","fullName":"Aaron Hicks","id":31253,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"31","lastName":"Hicks","lastNewsDate":1550084688000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":6.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":119.16435185185185,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":87.40310077519379,"percentStarted":80.81395348837209},"proTeamId":10,"seasonOutlook":"Hicks has been quite the find for the New York Yankees, especially in that he's a good hitter who is their most equipped to handle center field on a regular basis.

During that time, he posted an 87.5 percent contact rate, with that part of his game doing wonders to raise his floor in terms of both batting average and on-base percentage, the latter of which suffers due to his modest walk rate.

He stole only 30 bases, the lowest total in any professional season since his 2008 rookie-ball debut, and he was only 5-for-9 on stolen base attempts in 44 games from Aug. 1 forward. Gordon's raw speed didn't suffer significantly, but he simply couldn't find any sort of long-term period to recapture his past momentum, and his struggles looked worse because so much of his game depends upon his speed (including his ability to leg out base hits). If he's healthy come spring training, he's not quite at the stage of his career where he'll stop running, but his threshold for steals might nevertheless be closer to 45 than his career high of 64, especially since he might be more of a .270 hitter (with .290 on-base) than .300-plus (with .320). Gordon is a one-category performer worthy of a top-100 pick in rotisserie formats -- and arguably top 50 in deeper leagues where steals are scarcer -- but in points-based leagues, where his speed isn't nearly as useful, he's more of a mid-to-late round selection.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":557.0,"1":156.0,"2":0.280071813,"3":18.0,"4":8.0,"5":3.0,"6":29.0,"7":127.0,"8":199.0,"9":0.357271095,"10":15.0,"11":0.0,"12":9.0,"13":5.0,"14":14.0,"15":9.0,"16":593.0,"17":0.303541315,"18":0.66081241,"19":0.0,"20":80.0,"21":34.0,"22":0.0,"23":39.0,"24":12.0,"25":27.0,"26":9.0,"27":81.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":139.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":9,"statCategoryRanking":74,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":0.8542466},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.50794154},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":0.9360782},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.12086995},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":3.9645667}],"totalRanking":121,"totalRating":5.36782}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":32818,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":7,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":11,"rank":111,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[1,7,19,8,5,12,16,17],"firstName":"Joey","fullName":"Joey Gallo","id":32818,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"13","lastName":"Gallo","lastNewsDate":1545389439000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":6.285714285714286,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":126.93287037037037,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":88.37209302325581,"percentStarted":82.17054263565892},"proTeamId":13,"seasonOutlook":"Gallo's power is monstrous: He was second in baseball in home run rate (6.9 percent of his trips to the plate), he had the second-highest launch angle (21.5 degrees), the second-highest fly ball rate (37.2 percent), and he led the majors in average exit velocity on fly balls plus line drives (99.8 mph) and Statcast's \"Barrels\" per plate appearance metric (11.4 percent) last season. Unfortunately, other than that, the only other \"plus\" skill he possesses is patience, as he had a 12.8 percent walk rate, and his big-power approach comes with bushels of strikeouts, as he owns two of the 20 highest single-season strikeout totals in baseball history in just the past two seasons (207 in 2018, 10th most, and 196 in 2017, 20th most).

If you can stomach his miserable batting averages, or if you play in a league that uses on-base percentage instead, he's a worthwhile mid-round pick.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":486.0,"1":103.0,"2":0.211934156,"3":22.0,"4":2.0,"5":41.0,"6":65.0,"7":38.0,"8":252.0,"9":0.518518519,"10":75.0,"11":3.0,"12":5.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":566.0,"17":0.323321555,"18":0.841840073,"19":0.0,"20":79.0,"21":84.0,"22":0.0,"23":4.0,"24":4.0,"25":0.0,"26":3.0,"27":207.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":148.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":15,"statCategoryRanking":90,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":-2.231702},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":3.2573314},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":1.6074973},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":2.036026},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.1414011}],"totalRanking":149,"totalRating":4.527751}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":32933,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":8,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":11,"rank":112,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[8,9,10,5,12,16,17],"firstName":"Mallex","fullName":"Mallex Smith","id":32933,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"DAY_TO_DAY","jersey":"0","lastName":"Smith","lastNewsDate":1550333283000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":5.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":139.72453703703704,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":84.68992248062015,"percentStarted":75.1937984496124},"proTeamId":12,"seasonOutlook":"Few players did more to transform their offensive game in 2018 than Smith, who brought his strikeout rate to 18.0 percent for the full season (right in range with his minor league track record), boosted his line-drive rate to 27.9 percent and registered a .311 batting average and .390 on-base percentage after the All-Star break. He'll presumably be one of the trendier picks for stolen bases as a result, though he'll surely decline somewhat in terms of batting average and on-base percentage, considering he had a fourth-best-in-baseball .366 BABIP and faces a bit more competition for at-bats -- especially against lefties -- in a deeper Tampa Bay Rays outfield. The deeper the fantasy league, the more value Smith carries, though he's a top-100 candidate overall, even in shallow mixed, thanks to his speed.

Where Inciarte hits this season will significantly affect his production. The Braves are noncommittal, saying Acuna could lead off or clean up, with Inciarte's spot unclear. That said, Inciarte swiped four bags in September and posted a .361 OBP, by far his highest mark on the season. Besides steals, Inciarte's excellent contact rate offers a solid batting average floor, while a rising fly-ball rate has pushed his homers into double digits the past two seasons. Keep an eye on the spring lineups.

His on-field value has made him an underrated fantasy player in some circles, as Desmond was a below-replacement-level player in each of his first two seasons in Colorado. For the second straight season, Desmond hit the ball on the ground at an extremely high rate. And during his time with the Rockies, he has hit nearly as many homers on the road (19) as he's hit at Coors Field (20). With three pricey years remaining on his contract, Desmond should have a path to another 600 plate appearances in 2019, perhaps shifting into regular duty in the outfield. On another positive note, he drew walks a career-high rate last season, and it's likely that the .236 he hit in 2018 is his category floor in Colorado, despite his heavy ground ball tilt.

He's a potential draft-day value considering his age and the stigma tied to suspensions (see: Marte, Starling and Gordon, Dee), as he still has the skills required to put forth a top-10 fantasy second baseman season.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":593.0,"1":168.0,"2":0.283305228,"3":34.0,"4":1.0,"5":23.0,"6":58.0,"7":110.0,"8":273.0,"9":0.460370995,"10":54.0,"11":4.0,"12":5.0,"13":3.0,"14":3.0,"15":0.0,"16":655.0,"17":0.346564885,"18":0.80693588,"19":0.0,"20":88.0,"21":96.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":1.0,"25":-1.0,"26":13.0,"27":88.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":150.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":22,"statCategoryRanking":163,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":1.6921672},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":0.11960396},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":0.33180097},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.59965897},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.5976197}],"totalRanking":307,"totalRating":2.1456113}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":32532,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":2,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":10,"rank":118,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[0,12,16,17],"firstName":"Willson","fullName":"Willson Contreras","id":32532,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"40","lastName":"Contreras","lastNewsDate":1538331375000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":5.857142857142857,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":110.95359628770302,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":93.59223300970874,"percentStarted":90.48543689320388},"proTeamId":16,"seasonOutlook":"Contreras completely collapsed during the final third of the 2018 season, batting a miserable .173/.263/.237 in the Chicago Cubs' final 55 team games, his ground ball rate during that span soaring to 67.3 percent. It's difficult to explain it with anything other than there having been an unreported injury, because his past history of .280-ish batting averages, 10 percent walk rates and 15-20 homers made it look entirely out of character. Contreras does have a higher ground ball rate than a fantasy manager would like, putting a cap on his potential in the primary rotisserie categories, but he's a sound defensive backstop with a cannon arm, things that should continue to earn him regular playing time. The seeds are here for a rebound, and considering the dearth of quality offensive catchers these days, it's likely it'll be back into the top five at the position.

One of the most unexpectedly productive players in 2016, finishing fifth overall on the Player Rater (but only 44th among hitters in terms of fantasy points), he wound up as one of the game's greatest disappointments during his follow-up 2017. Things didn't go much better for him early in 2018, at least not until his inclusion in the deadline deal for Jonathan Schoop, after which point Villar was granted an everyday role as well as a hearty number of green lights on the basepaths -- he attempted a steal on 35 percent of his opportunities for the Orioles -- resulting in him being one of the 30 best players in rotisserie during that time. Villar's situation shouldn't change much entering 2019, as he'll play regularly, should run nearly as often and is one of the best bets for 15/40 numbers. In the best-case scenario, he might approach 2016's counting numbers with a lower batting average and on-base percentage. He's a borderline top-100 player in rotisserie, though his penchant for strikeouts makes him more of a mid-to-late-round pick in points-based mixed leagues.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":487.0,"1":126.0,"2":0.258726899,"3":19.0,"4":1.0,"5":14.0,"6":34.0,"7":92.0,"8":189.0,"9":0.388090349,"10":46.0,"11":0.0,"12":3.0,"13":1.0,"14":2.0,"15":1.0,"16":538.0,"17":0.32527881,"18":0.713369159,"19":0.0,"20":60.0,"21":48.0,"22":0.0,"23":38.0,"24":8.0,"25":30.0,"26":9.0,"27":140.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":143.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":5,"statCategoryRanking":46,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":0.3607708},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":0.5379676},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":0.6675105},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.4628621},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":4.724931}],"totalRanking":80,"totalRating":6.7540417}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":33215,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":6,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":10,"rank":120,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[4,6,19,12,16,17],"firstName":"Amed","fullName":"Amed Rosario","id":33215,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"1","lastName":"Rosario","lastNewsDate":1538299134000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":2.857142857142857,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":154.2505800464037,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":80.58252427184466,"percentStarted":52.42718446601942},"proTeamId":21,"seasonOutlook":"For the first calendar year of his big league career, Rosario seemed lost. He batted just .241/.277/.370 -- his .283 wOBA fifth worst among qualifiers during that time span -- and chased non-strikes 37 percent of the time, 14th-most often in the majors. Something clicked shortly thereafter, as improving patience last June and July led him to .284/.318/.413 triple-slash rates, five home runs, 24 RBIs, a 15-for-20 performance stealing bases and 37 runs scored in 54 games from Aug. 1 forward. During that time, Rosario showed significantly greater contact and more of a line-drive approach. And while he hardly turned into a walker, he was a bit less free-swinging than he had been in his first year in the bigs. Those improvements bode well for his prospects in his second full big league campaign in 2019, as he might be able to up his batting average to .260 and on-base percentage to .300, which would be significant, considering the frequency of green lights he received late last season. Rosario could be a 10-homer, 30-steal performer, which would probably be enough for top-10 shortstop status in rotisserie leagues. Until he develops more patience, though, he's more middle-infielder material in points leagues.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":565.0,"1":143.0,"2":0.253097345,"3":25.0,"4":7.0,"5":9.0,"6":41.0,"7":102.0,"8":209.0,"9":0.369911504,"10":29.0,"11":3.0,"12":4.0,"13":4.0,"14":6.0,"15":2.0,"16":604.0,"17":0.291390728,"18":0.661302233,"19":0.0,"20":76.0,"21":55.0,"22":0.0,"23":22.0,"24":11.0,"25":11.0,"26":11.0,"27":131.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":148.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":16,"statCategoryRanking":75,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":0.23679604},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":0.01501305},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":1.4060715},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.63385814},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":3.0521293}],"totalRanking":122,"totalRating":5.3438683}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":33859,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":5,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":10,"rank":122,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[3,7,19,12,16,17],"firstName":"Rafael","fullName":"Rafael

He hit an empty .253/.322/.398 and graded out as a poor defender at first base while also forcing Wil Myers off the position upon arrival. Throughout his time in Kansas City, Hosmer had wild fluctuations in output from year to year, and it's easy to wonder if seeing a heavy dose of unfamiliar pitchers and parks played a role in his disappointing season, as he struggled against breaking balls and off-speed offerings. Entering the second year of his contract, Hosmer should remain a fixture on the lineup card for manager Andy Green, and his counting stats could improve if he rebounds at the plate while the talent around him continues to get better.

After consecutive seasons with a batting average more than 20 points above his career mark (.246), Dozier fell to a career-worst .215 average despite posting the highest hard-hit rate of his career (37.3 percent). Not surprisingly, his stolen-base output matched a five-year low as well, but he was an efficient 12-for-15 on the basepaths. Things didn't get better after a July trade to the Dodgers, as he finished with a .187/.289/.326 line and a 22.6 percent strikeout rate during the second half. Dozier revealed in September that he played through a knee injury all season, yet he managed to top 150 games played for the fifth straight season. With health, a bounce-back in Washington seems likely since the underlying plate skills he possessed in 2016 and 2017 were intact.

five-category sensation during the final third of the 2018 season, Mondesi enters 2019 as one of the most divisive picks. He batted .280/.317/.543 with 11 home runs, 26 RBIs, 23 stolen bases and 28 runs scored in the team's final 54 games, numbers that made him one of the 10 most valuable players in rotisserie leagues, but he also did it with questionable underlying skills. During that same span, Mondesi's 18.2 percent swinging-strike rate ranked among the five worst in the game, his 4.8 percent walk rate ranked among the game's bottom 20, and he was granted the green light to steal on an outrageous -- and unsustainable -- 48 percent of his opportunities. There is going to be regression to his per-game rates in 2019, probably a significant amount, though the degree to which is the question. Kansas City Royals manager Ned Yost is among the more apt to give continued green lights, and there's precious little competition for at-bats, so Mondesi's floor is probably higher than you think it is. He's probably more of a top-100 than top-50 pick in rotisserie leagues, though, and his poor plate approach suggests those thresholds should be doubled in points-based scoring.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":541.0,"1":132.0,"2":0.243992606,"3":28.0,"4":10.0,"5":16.0,"6":54.0,"7":78.0,"8":228.0,"9":0.421441774,"10":24.0,"11":1.0,"12":3.0,"13":6.0,"14":18.0,"15":12.0,"16":578.0,"17":0.275086505,"18":0.69652828,"19":0.0,"20":74.0,"21":62.0,"22":0.0,"23":46.0,"24":9.0,"25":37.0,"26":12.0,"27":158.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":147.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":12,"statCategoryRanking":54,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":0.7287442},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":0.5379676},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":0.43251383},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.15506916},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":4.2687125}],"totalRanking":95,"totalRating":6.1230073}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":32820,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":9,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":9,"rank":134,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[10,5,12,16,17],"firstName":"Nomar","fullName":"Nomar Mazara","id":32820,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"30","lastName":"Mazara","lastNewsDate":1548305986000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":1.8571428571428572,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":163.63194444444446,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":83.72093023255815,"percentStarted":73.06201550387597},"proTeamId":13,"stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":528.0,"1":137.0,"2":0.259469697,"3":25.0,"4":2.0,"5":21.0,"6":48.0,"7":89.0,"8":229.0,"9":0.433712121,"10":45.0,"11":3.0,"12":5.0,"13":4.0,"14":4.0,"15":0.0,"16":582.0,"17":0.321305842,"18":0.755017963,"19":0.0,"20":59.0,"21":77.0,"22":0.0,"23":1.0,"24":1.0,"25":0.0,"26":12.0,"27":124.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":141.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":15,"statCategoryRanking":119,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":0.27962327},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":1.1655132},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":0.90250725},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":1.5230377},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.44554687}],"totalRanking":225,"totalRating":3.4251344}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":31130,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":4,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":9,"rank":136,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[2,6,19,12,16,17],"firstName":"Cesar","fullName":"Cesar Hernandez","id":31130,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"16","lastName":"Hernandez","lastNewsDate":1547216161000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":2.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":173.93967517401393,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":78.64077669902913,"percentStarted":41.74757281553398},"proTeamId":22,"seasonOutlook":"A staple at the top of the Phillies' order the past few seasons, offseason acquisitions may force Hernandez to the bottom third, with Jean Segura and perhaps Andrew McCutchen earmarked for the top two spots.

Specifically, after the break, Hernandez's strikeout rate rose from 20.6 percent to 23.9 percent while his BABIP plummeted 52 points to .286. Hernandez was successful on 14-of-16 stolen base attempts before the break, but was a poor 5-for-9 after that. Hernandez will reportedly be healthy entering spring training, and his skills should remain sneaky good, especially in OBP leagues.

Tommy John surgery will preclude him from pitching this season, but because he's so adept with the bat, he's more than capable of handling everyday designated hitter duties for the Los Angeles Angels, if they so wish. He might not be ready to play until several weeks into the season, but once healthy, he's a legitimately elite power source, having posted the majors' eighth-best isolated power (.279) and 10th-best hard contact rate (50.2 percent) amongst hitters with at least 350 plate appearances. Ohtani's 27.8 percent strikeout rate is a bit of a concern in terms of repeating his lofty batting average, and his .222/.300/.354 triple-slash line against left-handed pitchers could be a further concern if he's a true regular, but all the chatter about his hitting when he came over from Japan seems entirely valid (if not understated). As for those of you wondering about his pitching prospects in dynasty/keeper leagues, we'll see. The Angels plan on a bright future for him in their rotation, and he sure looked like an ace in the 10 starts he made, but he will once again face injury and workload questions entering 2020.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":404.0,"1":115.0,"2":0.284653465,"3":26.0,"4":3.0,"5":24.0,"6":53.0,"7":62.0,"8":219.0,"9":0.542079208,"10":44.0,"11":2.0,"12":2.0,"13":1.0,"14":1.0,"15":0.0,"16":451.0,"17":0.356984479,"18":0.899063687,"19":0.0,"20":71.0,"21":74.0,"22":0.0,"23":12.0,"24":5.0,"25":7.0,"26":4.0,"27":124.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":128.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":3,"statCategoryRanking":77,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":1.149327},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":1.374695},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":0.8353653},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.9758503},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":0.92310905}],"totalRanking":127,"totalRating":5.2583466}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":30112,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":2,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":8,"rank":141,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[0,12,16,17],"firstName":"Buster","fullName":"Buster Posey","id":30112,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"28","lastName":"Posey","lastNewsDate":1549657592000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":5.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":116.96983758700696,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":91.06796116504854,"percentStarted":84.27184466019418},"proTeamId":26,"seasonOutlook":"Posey's home run output dropped for the fourth straight season, as he delivered just five long balls in 448 plate appearances before undergoing season-ending hip surgery in August. The procedure was focused on repairing his labrum, which requires a six-to-eight-month recovery period, leaving his availability for Opening Day in question. Even with things progressing well over the winter, Posey will be limited when spring training gets underway and possibly after the Cactus League schedule begins. Despite the power outage, Posey maintained his typically excellent plate discipline, posting a double-digit walk rate and a sub-12 percent strikeout rate for the third season in a row. Given his age (he turns 32 in March), the injury he's recovering from and the potential for a reduced workload in 2019, a bounce-back for Posey would likely entail a .300 average, 10-12 homers and 60-70 RBI, rather than the 20-plus-homer pop and 100-RBI ceiling he offered at his peak.

His patience and plate discipline is almost unparalleled: He was second in walk-per-strikeout rate (1.18) and fourth in walk rate (16.2 percent) among batting-title-eligible players last season. It's those traits that make him significantly more valuable in points-based (and sabermetrically angled) leagues: He was the No. 23 hitter in those, but only 116th on our Player Rater, in 2018. With Santana, you know what you get, with any profit potential tied to his spot in the Cleveland Indians' batting order. Side note: If your league has a lesser games-played threshold for position qualification, be aware that he played 19 games at third base last year.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":560.0,"1":142.0,"2":0.253571429,"3":32.0,"4":2.0,"5":25.0,"6":59.0,"7":83.0,"8":253.0,"9":0.451785714,"10":105.0,"11":5.0,"12":3.0,"13":6.0,"14":7.0,"15":1.0,"16":675.0,"17":0.37037037,"18":0.822156085,"19":0.0,"20":84.0,"21":85.0,"22":0.0,"23":3.0,"24":2.0,"25":1.0,"26":11.0,"27":89.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":158.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":15,"statCategoryRanking":117,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":-1.236038},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":1.5838767},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":1.6074973},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":1.8308307},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.293474}],"totalRanking":219,"totalRating":3.4926927}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":29999,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":5,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":8,"rank":149,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[3,7,19,12,16,17],"firstName":"Mike","fullName":"Mike Moustakas","id":29999,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"18","lastName":"Moustakas","lastNewsDate":1550441352000,"lastVideoDate":1538708874000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":1.5714285714285714,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":143.5787037037037,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":87.20930232558139,"percentStarted":66.66666666666667},"proTeamId":8,"seasonOutlook":"Moustakas returned to the Royals as a bargain free-agent signing last offseason, getting a one-year deal with a mutual option, and netting the Royals two MLB-ready pieces at the trade deadline when they flipped him to the Brewers for Brett Phillips and Jorge Lopez. Although he took a step back from the career-high 38 homers he swatted in 2017, Moustakas racked up 28 homers and 95 RBIs over 152 games, posting a slash line (.251/.315/.459) very close to his career mark (.251/.307/.431). Even though he's not the Gold Glove-level player he was earlier in his career, he is still an average defender at third base, which is ample in terms of driving up his playing time. Plus, he's been good enough against lefties over the past four seasons to avoid falling into a strict platoon. Thanks to his low OBP, he'll likely be a low-cost addition for another club in 2019; he became a free agent again in October.
