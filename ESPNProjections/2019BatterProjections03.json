Not surprisingly, he offered plenty of pop along the way (26 homers) and his defense improved from terrible to below average. As for the downside, he still didn't bring much to the table in terms of batting average, hitting .238 and carrying an XBA (.244) that doesn't offer much hope if his current batted-ball profile is his true baseline. The aforementioned defensive improvement probably isn't enough to spare him from late-inning exits in close games, and he seems unlikely to get more starts against left-handed pitching even though he improved against southpaws in limited chances (85 wRC+). Most likely, he will remain capped on the big side of a platoon in left field while offering 25-30 homer pop and a mediocre average.

Make no mistake, though: Molina is aging (albeit gracefully), as his .261 batting average was his lowest in 12 years, he has posted the two worst strikeout rates in any full year of his career in the past two seasons and his expected wOBA (per Statcast) has been trending in the wrong direction in the past two years despite his distinct shift toward driving the ball.

But a closer look reveals that his approach shifted, as he hit more fly balls than ever before (29.5 percent) en route to a career-high 15 homers. At age 30, it's possible that LeMahieu is trying to maximize the overall value of his skillset, parlaying his ability to maintain a low strikeout rate and spray the ball to all fields with an added willingness to pull the ball in the air to do damage when appropriate. That will play well at Yankee Stadium, his new home park as a result of him signing a two-year deal with New York. LeMahieu's elite defensive skills should help him earn at-bats with his new club, but given the Yankees' depth, he may open the season in some sort of utility role. Leaving Colorado often drives down the price of hitters, and there are some concerns about playing time, but LeMahieu might be a sneaky player in the midst of a mid-career power surge, available on the cheap this draft season.

Martinez made quite a bit more contact in 2018 (80.5 percent) than in 2017 (77.9 percent), posted a near-identical hard contact rate and tallied 590 plate appearances despite those defensive questions. Competition will be fiercer this time around with Paul Goldschmidt on board, but the lineup will also be deeper, which will help Martinez's counting numbers.

When he was on the field, it was easy to wonder if Cabrera was healthy, as his ground ball rate skyrocketed to a career-high 54.6 percent (up from 39.8 percent in 2017) and his home run output plummeted to just three long balls in 157 plate appearances. Cabrera still walked a lot (14.0 percent walk rate), but his .448 SLG was the second-lowest mark of his career, ahead of only the .399 mark he posted in 2017. Cabrera resumed hitting in December, and he's expected to be 100 percent healthy for the start of spring training. With consecutive injury-marred campaigns and his 36th birthday coming in April, it's fair to wonder if Father Time has caught up to Cabrera once and for all. If a bounce-back season in the power department happens, it might be accompanied by more frequent days off. Making things bleaker, the Tigers are in the early stages of a major rebuilding process which has left a very weak supporting cast around Cabrera.

His contact and hard-hit rates are both well above average -- not for a catcher, but for all batters. A high ground ball rate caps power, but because he hits the ball hard, he gets more hits on the ground than most players so slow afoot. Plus, when he does put it in the air, his HR/FB mark is consistently high. Durability is becoming an issue, as Ramos missed a month last season with a sore hamstring while also dealing with hand injuries on a couple of occasions. The veteran backstop's defense and game-calling remain solid, though. Ramos is the perfect compromise between paying market price for the elite receivers and waiting until the late game at the position.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":399.0,"1":117.0,"2":0.293233083,"3":19.0,"4":1.0,"5":17.0,"6":37.0,"7":80.0,"8":189.0,"9":0.473684211,"10":30.0,"11":2.0,"12":0.0,"13":2.0,"14":2.0,"15":0.0,"16":431.0,"17":0.341067285,"18":0.814751496,"19":0.0,"20":40.0,"21":68.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":16.0,"27":79.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":116.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":3,"statCategoryRanking":113,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":2.1360688},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":0.6425585},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":0.1639462},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":1.2836432},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.5976197}],"totalRanking":205,"totalRating":3.628597}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":30819,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":5,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":7,"rank":166,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[3,7,19,12,16,17],"firstName":"Kyle","fullName":"Kyle Seager","id":30819,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"15","lastName":"Seager","lastNewsDate":1538147386000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":1.2857142857142858,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":182.22453703703704,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":77.71317829457364,"percentStarted":51.35658914728682},"proTeamId":12,"seasonOutlook":"After posting a career year in 2016, Seager declined significantly each of the past two campaigns. Last season was, by far, the worst in his eight-year career, as he set a personal high in strikeout rate and a low in walk rate. Unfortunately, Seager was also held back by a low .251 BABIP, exacerbating the slide in plate skills. The silver lining is the underlying metrics pointed to a higher hit rate, so there's positive regression in store. Whether Seager can recapture his previous plate skills is unclear, though at 31 years old, it's hard to envision him just losing it. Another plus is Seager's solid defense, which keeps him on the field. Speaking of which, Seager also has volume on his side, averaging 154 games and 663 plate appearances since 2012. Expect a modest rebound, tempered by a weaker supporting cast than previous seasons.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":586.0,"1":141.0,"2":0.240614334,"3":36.0,"4":1.0,"5":25.0,"6":62.0,"7":79.0,"8":254.0,"9":0.433447099,"10":49.0,"11":3.0,"12":7.0,"13":5.0,"14":5.0,"15":0.0,"16":647.0,"17":0.304482226,"18":0.737929325,"19":0.0,"20":73.0,"21":89.0,"22":0.0,"23":2.0,"24":2.0,"25":0.0,"26":8.0,"27":124.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":156.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":22,"statCategoryRanking":174,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":-1.6745057},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":1.374695},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":0.9360782},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":1.5572369},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.293474}],"totalRanking":331,"totalRating":1.9000304}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":32068,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":9,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":6,"rank":169,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[10,5,12,16,17],"firstName":"Adam","fullName":"Adam Eaton","id":32068,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"2","lastName":"Eaton","lastNewsDate":1550340670000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.8571428571428571,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":192.3735498839907,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":77.0873786407767,"percentStarted":59.41747572815534},"proTeamId":20,"seasonOutlook":"Injuries have obviously played a huge part, but the Nationals were expecting more when they acquired Eaton a couple of years ago. The concern now, even if Eaton is healthy, revolves around platoon splits, as Eaton has struggled mightily against southpaws since moving to the Senior circuit. By the book, he may not own these splits, but management may still decide to drop him into a platoon, especially since Michael A. Taylor has proved capable against left-handers. Additionally, there's also a chance Eaton hits lower in the order if Victor Robles demonstrates he's ready to join Trea Turner at the top. Eaton's contact and plate discipline provide a solid floor, albeit with limited power. Swiping nine bags in 10 tries shows Eaton can still contribute in that category. However, his playing-time concerns may make him better suited for daily leagues so you know for sure if he is in the lineup.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":436.0,"1":130.0,"2":0.298165138,"3":22.0,"4":3.0,"5":7.0,"6":32.0,"7":98.0,"8":179.0,"9":0.410550459,"10":49.0,"11":0.0,"12":10.0,"13":1.0,"14":3.0,"15":2.0,"16":498.0,"17":0.379518072,"18":0.790068531,"19":0.0,"20":72.0,"21":44.0,"22":0.0,"23":12.0,"24":2.0,"25":10.0,"26":3.0,"27":84.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":117.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":18,"statCategoryRanking":144,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":1.6567816},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.4033506},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":0.7010815},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.018272307},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":0.77103615}],"totalRanking":265,"totalRating":2.743821}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":31260,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":5,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":6,"rank":171,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[3,7,19,12,16,17],"firstName":"Miguel","fullName":"Miguel Sano","id":31260,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"DAY_TO_DAY","jersey":"22","lastName":"Sano","lastNewsDate":1550423650000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":1.4285714285714286,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":205.2314814814815,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":69.18604651162791,"percentStarted":27.906976744186046},"proTeamId":9,"seasonOutlook":"Hamstring and knee injuries ruined Sano's 2018, and his performance when healthy was so beneath expectations that at one point he was demoted to Class A ball -- granted to give him more access to the team's spring training facility rather than belonging there on merit -- for what was an eventual six-week stint in the minors. While he possesses power that can rival most anyone in baseball, with 84 home runs, .233 isolated power, a 15.5 percent Statcast \"Barrel\" per batted ball and 48.0 percent hard-contact rate in parts of four big-league seasons, his penchant for strikeouts puts him at massive risk for slumps and a low batting average. Even in his best of the four big-league seasons, he finished only 193rd on the Player Rater and tied for 249th in fantasy points, in 2017, so he'd need to have an eye-opening spring in order to warrant more than a late-round pick in rotisserie leagues or more than an AL-only/deep-mixed look in points-based formats. Sano's defense has also come into question, which is another problem that could cap his 2019 potential, as the Minnesota Twins added Nelson Cruz at designated hitter and effectively need Sano to handle the third base duties.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":436.0,"1":99.0,"2":0.22706422,"3":20.0,"4":1.0,"5":25.0,"6":46.0,"7":53.0,"8":196.0,"9":0.449541284,"10":54.0,"11":1.0,"12":2.0,"13":2.0,"14":2.0,"15":0.0,"16":494.0,"17":0.313765182,"18":0.763306467,"19":0.0,"20":60.0,"21":70.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":9.0,"27":180.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":117.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":37,"statCategoryRanking":321,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":-1.5170034},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":0.4333767},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.071050495},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.29186603},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.5976197}],"totalRanking":749,"totalRating":-1.460431}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":32146,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":6,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":6,"rank":172,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[4,6,19,12,16,17],"firstName":"Marcus","fullName":"Marcus Semien","id":32146,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"10","lastName":"Semien","lastNewsDate":1547206405000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.7142857142857143,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":197.23842592592592,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":74.03100775193798,"percentStarted":37.4031007751938},"proTeamId":11,"seasonOutlook":"Semien returned to his everyday playing ways in 2018, but now with four full seasons under his belt, that 2016 power surge is looking more and more like an outlier.

Driving the power outage was a drop in hard-hit rate and decreased production versus right-handed pitching. In 2017, Gurriel hit 15 of his 18 homers facing righties, compared to just six of 13 last season. Because Gurriel put the ball in play 89 percent of the time, he usually hit in the heart of a productive order, helping produce a lofty 85 RBIs in just 573 plate appearances.

A bruised left index finger suffered when he was hit by a pitch in mid-August cost him a disabled list stint, though, and he never really recaptured the same magic following his return.

He's one of the smarter fourth/fifth outfielders you could pick, and in those aforementioned points leagues, he could be a more significant contributor.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":526.0,"1":133.0,"2":0.252851711,"3":34.0,"4":8.0,"5":18.0,"6":60.0,"7":73.0,"8":237.0,"9":0.450570342,"10":92.0,"11":2.0,"12":19.0,"13":1.0,"14":1.0,"15":0.0,"16":638.0,"17":0.382445141,"18":0.833015483,"19":0.0,"20":91.0,"21":58.0,"22":0.0,"23":8.0,"24":6.0,"25":2.0,"26":8.0,"27":163.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":151.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":14,"statCategoryRanking":102,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":0.4975763},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":0.85174036},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":1.4396425},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.4970613},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":0.77103615}],"totalRanking":175,"totalRating":4.0570564}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":30175,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":3,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":6,"rank":176,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[1,7,19,12,16,17],"firstName":"Justin","fullName":"Justin Smoak","id":30175,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"14","lastName":"Smoak","lastNewsDate":1540915532000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":1.5714285714285714,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":200.33564814814815,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":73.83720930232558,"percentStarted":30.426356589147286},"proTeamId":14,"seasonOutlook":"A power breakout was expected from Smoak long before 2017, as he was consistently among the leaders in fly ball distance, a strong indicator for home runs.

Smoak's fly ball rate has always been high, so it was a matter of maintaining a high HR/FB and contact rate. Both elements fell last season, resulting in a significant drop in power. Chances are, one or both will rebound this season, pushing Smoak's homers back around the 30 mark. Contact is still an issue, so his batting average is likely going to be a detriment.

He hit noticeably more balls in the air -- his Statcast launch angle soared from 8.3 to 14.3 degrees, among the largest jumps in the game -- and for the first time in his six major league seasons he got green lights less than 30 percent of the time (25.0 percent in 2018). Now in Kansas City, Hamilton can only hope that the Royals afford him more freedom on the base paths, something that seems likely considering manager Ned Yost's recent tendencies, and he should resume his ground ball-oriented approach to hitting considering how poor Kauffman Stadium is for power. There's a lot of rebound potential in this move, especially if the Royals slot Hamilton atop the lineup in an attempt to maximize his stolen bases, something that might boost his runs scored total as well. He's a one-category performer far more valuable in rotisserie than points-based leagues -- Hamilton is barely even draft-worthy in mixed leagues in the latter -- but if you're seeking steals in the middle rounds, he's a worthy gamble.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":507.0,"1":125.0,"2":0.246548323,"3":18.0,"4":9.0,"5":3.0,"6":30.0,"7":95.0,"8":170.0,"9":0.33530572,"10":42.0,"11":0.0,"12":1.0,"13":3.0,"14":5.0,"15":2.0,"16":555.0,"17":0.302702703,"18":0.638008423,"19":0.0,"20":73.0,"21":28.0,"22":0.0,"23":43.0,"24":9.0,"25":34.0,"26":3.0,"27":111.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":140.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":11,"statCategoryRanking":91,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.770084},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.50794154},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":1.3389297},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.11852455},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":4.5728583}],"totalRanking":150,"totalRating":4.515238}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":31728,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":6,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":6,"rank":179,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[4,6,19,12,16,17],"firstName":"Andrelton","fullName":"Andrelton Simmons","id":31728,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"2","lastName":"Simmons","lastNewsDate":1538303949000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.7142857142857143,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":167.34027777777777,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":83.13953488372093,"percentStarted":60.27131782945737},"proTeamId":3,"seasonOutlook":"Arguably the game's best defensive player, and a shortstop at that, Simmons is assured a maximum of playing time in which to generate counting numbers.

Dickerson ended up hitting a surprising .300 for the first time away from Coors Field, and did so by dramatically reducing his strikeout rate to 15.0 percent last season. An improved approach that focused on contact over power saw him reduce his swinging strike rate by nearly 4 full percentage points and push his overall contact rate up from 74 percent to 80 percent.

Bauers is worth a look in the late rounds of mixed leagues, but he might be best suited for daily leagues, where you can pick and choose his matchups, preferably avoiding games against left-handed pitchers and using those in hitter-friendly parks.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":506.0,"1":121.0,"2":0.239130435,"3":35.0,"4":1.0,"5":15.0,"6":51.0,"7":70.0,"8":203.0,"9":0.401185771,"10":67.0,"11":0.0,"12":4.0,"13":5.0,"14":7.0,"15":2.0,"16":583.0,"17":0.329331046,"18":0.730516817,"19":0.0,"20":75.0,"21":70.0,"22":0.0,"23":13.0,"24":9.0,"25":4.0,"26":6.0,"27":132.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":138.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":34,"statCategoryRanking":263,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":-1.7246026},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":0.22419488},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":0.4660848},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.5312605},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":0.31481755}],"totalRanking":544,"totalRating":-0.18824483}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":33675,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":6,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":5,"rank":184,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[4,6,19,12,16,17],"firstName":"Willy","fullName":"Willy Adames","id":33675,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"1","lastName":"Adames","lastNewsDate":1538343539000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.42857142857142855,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":224.7476851851852,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":59.30232558139535,"percentStarted":18.7984496124031},"proTeamId":30,"seasonOutlook":"Summoned for good by the Tampa Bay Rays in mid-June, Adames held his own as a rookie, his .278/.348/.406 rates in 85 games remarkably close to the .280/.358/.414 numbers he had in 194 Triple-A games between 2017-18.

Another issue is that Herrera's defense in center was a detriment. With the Phillies in go-for-it mode, Herrera will need to find a way to revert to 2016 form, lest he fall in jeopardy of losing playing time.

The main reason was Bell's hard-hit and fly ball rates didn't portend such a lofty power surge, so the resultant 19.1 HR/FB mark was due to regress. Sure enough, last season, Bell maintained similar underlying power metrics, yet posted a 9.2 HR/FB. The only difference from the previous season was the switch-hitter pulled the ball more in 2017, but that doesn't explain the entire difference, if any. Bell's above-average plate skills drive a solid floor, especially in OBP and points leagues. After that, his fantasy potential will be defined by his ability to produce runs, which is obviously team-dependent. The Pirates finished in the lower half in scoring last season and probably will again, dampening Bell's run and RBI potential.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":505.0,"1":132.0,"2":0.261386139,"3":28.0,"4":5.0,"5":15.0,"6":48.0,"7":84.0,"8":215.0,"9":0.425742574,"10":71.0,"11":2.0,"12":3.0,"13":4.0,"14":4.0,"15":0.0,"16":583.0,"17":0.353344768,"18":0.779087343,"19":0.0,"20":74.0,"21":71.0,"22":0.0,"23":2.0,"24":5.0,"25":-3.0,"26":13.0,"27":103.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":148.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":17,"statCategoryRanking":138,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":0.47074005},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":0.32878578},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":1.3389297},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":1.0100495},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.293474}],"totalRanking":253,"totalRating":2.855031}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":30272,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":6,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":5,"rank":191,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[3,4,6,7,19,12,16,17],"firstName":"Eduardo","fullName":"Eduardo Escobar","id":30272,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"5","lastName":"Escobar","lastNewsDate":1540220720000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.5714285714285714,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":209.5568445475638,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":70.87378640776699,"percentStarted":34.95145631067961},"proTeamId":29,"seasonOutlook":"Escobar picked the right time to have a career year and capitalized by signing a three-year deal to return to the Diamondbacks in lieu of testing the free-agent market. A utility infielder throughout his career, Escobar began the campaign as the Twins' regular shortstop with Jorge Polanco suspended. He shifted to the hot corner when Polanco returned, maintaining full-time status. Arizona acquired Escobar in late July, ostensibly as a utility man. However, Jake Lamb hurt his shoulder, simultaneous with the trade, so Escobar took over for the rest of the season. Aside from setting personal highs in games and plate appearances, Escobar's 117 wRC+ was his best ever, fueled by posting an above-average hard-hit rate for the first time. Escobar is earmarked to be the Opening Day third baseman, though he retains shortstop eligibility.

He's among the top candidates for Rookie of the Year honors, should be regarded as a top-40 fantasy outfielder, even if he spends the first few weeks of the season in the minors, and in fact has slightly greater value in points-based than rotisserie leagues thanks to his reputation for good contact.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":405.0,"1":118.0,"2":0.291358025,"3":23.0,"4":2.0,"5":19.0,"6":44.0,"7":74.0,"8":202.0,"9":0.498765432,"10":27.0,"11":2.0,"12":3.0,"13":5.0,"14":5.0,"15":0.0,"16":440.0,"17":0.336363636,"18":0.835129068,"19":0.0,"20":51.0,"21":59.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":2.0,"25":-2.0,"26":13.0,"27":84.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":106.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":0,"statCategoryRanking":0,"statRankings":[],"totalRanking":0,"totalRating":0.0}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":35185,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":6,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":5,"rank":194,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[4,6,19,12,16,17],"firstName":"Paul","fullName":"Paul DeJong","id":35185,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"12","lastName":"DeJong","lastNewsDate":1549144132000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.42857142857142855,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":228.78422273781902,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":59.22330097087379,"percentStarted":20.194174757281555},"proTeamId":24,"seasonOutlook":"DeJong burst onto the scene in 2017 with a 25-homer showing over 443 plate appearances, flashing the pop necessary to project as a 30-plus-homer bat with a full season's worth of playing time.

A broken hand in May might have been the primary culprit for his reduced power output, as he hit eight homers in 171 plate appearances (.473 SLG) before suffering the injury in mid-May. The addition of Paul Goldschmidt provides a big boost to the St. Louis lineup, and if Goldschmidt bats second in the order, DeJong would be the favorite to open the season in the coveted third spot. He should have plenty of run and RBI chances if he does bat third, which would be good enough to offset his batting average risk and minimal contributions as a base stealer.

He batted just .156 and struck out in 29.8 percent of his trips to the plate in the season's first two months, landed on the disabled list due to migraines, broke his toe in his first minor league rehabilitation game, and was unable to fully recover from the latter until midsummer. By that point, the Minnesota Twins decided to keep him at Triple-A Rochester in order to push back his free agency by a year, though his .274/.333/.459 triple-slash rates in 35 games for them hardly demanded a promotion back to the big club. Buxton should be in the lead for the center field job this spring, in large part because of his elite defense, and he still has the exceptional speed along with a hint of pop that make him an intriguing speculative rotisserie pick. So long as he looks healthy in March, he's worthy of a mid-to-late round pick, though his mediocre plate discipline makes him a bit less valuable than that in points leagues.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":489.0,"1":117.0,"2":0.239263804,"3":26.0,"4":5.0,"5":14.0,"6":45.0,"7":72.0,"8":195.0,"9":0.398773006,"10":32.0,"11":1.0,"12":4.0,"13":1.0,"14":4.0,"15":3.0,"16":529.0,"17":0.289224953,"18":0.687997959,"19":0.0,"20":72.0,"21":50.0,"22":0.0,"23":22.0,"24":2.0,"25":20.0,"26":3.0,"27":160.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":140.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":56,"statCategoryRanking":505,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":-1.027646},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.9263052},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.87675345},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.9735049},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":0.16274466}],"totalRanking":1231,"totalRating":-3.6414647}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":32525,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":6,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":5,"rank":196,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[4,6,19,12,16,17],"firstName":"Jorge","fullName":"Jorge Polanco","id":32525,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"11","lastName":"Polanco","lastNewsDate":1550161197000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":1.7142857142857142,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":229.55324074074073,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":56.58914728682171,"percentStarted":17.248062015503876},"proTeamId":9,"seasonOutlook":"There was a fair amount of hype surrounding Polanco heading into the 2018 season before he was hit with an 80-game PED suspension. The ironic part about the story is that his final 2018 triple-slash line (.288/.345/.427) was better than what he did in 2017 (.256/.313/.410). If we lazily doubled his 2018 numbers, he would have equaled or exceeded his counting numbers from the 2017 seasons. Dating back to August 1, 2017, Polanco has been 25 percent better than the league average offensively and has a .299/.358/.478 line over nearly 570 plate appearances. There is an excellent chance Polanco hits leadoff in 2019 for a retooled Minnesota lineup that added a lot of pop this offseason. Polanco has the on-base chops to make that work and could see a significant spike in his runs scored this season.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":572.0,"1":155.0,"2":0.270979021,"3":33.0,"4":6.0,"5":13.0,"6":52.0,"7":103.0,"8":239.0,"9":0.417832168,"10":45.0,"11":0.0,"12":4.0,"13":4.0,"14":10.0,"15":6.0,"16":631.0,"17":0.323296355,"18":0.741128523,"19":0.0,"20":68.0,"21":78.0,"22":0.0,"23":13.0,"24":9.0,"25":4.0,"26":9.0,"27":106.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":150.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":33,"statCategoryRanking":182,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":1.167165},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.2987597},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":0.13037524},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.32606524},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":0.46689042}],"totalRanking":347,"totalRating":1.7917362}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":28513,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":8,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":5,"rank":197,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[9,10,5,12,16,17],"firstName":"Adam","fullName":"Adam Jones","id":28513,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"10","lastName":"Jones","lastNewsDate":1537690063000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.8571428571428571,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":201.15509259259258,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":70.15503875968992,"percentStarted":55.42635658914729},"proTeamId":1,"seasonOutlook":"Jones closed out his six-year, $85.5 million deal with the Orioles last season, remaining in Baltimore in a completely lost season and topping 600 plate appearances for the eighth time in the last nine campaigns.

But his power slipped, as he failed to hit 20 homers for the first time since 2010. Only two outfielders graded out as worse defenders based on Statcast's Outs Above Average formula in 2018, and a full-time move to a corner-outfield spot will almost certainly come in 2019. Now 33 years old, he may be forced to take a short-term deal or accept a part-time role to land with a contender.

A natural third baseman who also played second base in college, Senzel dabbled at shortstop early last season, though the team appears set at all three of those positions. He might factor into the team's outfield picture, though there's little doubt that his bat could help the big club right now, considering he batted .310/.378/.509 in 44 games for Triple-A Louisville in 2018, before a broken right index finger prematurely ended his season. Senzel also required an October surgery to remove bone spurs from his left elbow, so he'll bear watching during spring training, and might begin the year in the minors in order to first work his way back to full strength. He'll almost assuredly make his debut for the Reds during 2019, though, and could be a borderline top-10 fantasy third baseman from that point forward, with his skill set slightly more attractive in points-based than rotisserie leagues.

He didn't become \"unclutch\"; he was a victim of poor timing, clustering hits without ducks on the pond. Of some concern are exaggerated splits, as Choo slashed .293/.405/.506 over the first half, in contrast to .217/.329/.316 during the second half. Perhaps it was due to the hotter-than-normal Texas heat wearing down the 36-year-old veteran. Choo is assured of playing nearly every day when healthy, which he was the past two seasons. At some point, Father Time catches up to everyone, but there's no indication Choo is in decline.

Be it Statcast data, plate skills or batted ball distribution, they're all remarkably similar. Yet, in 2017 Mancini recorded a .352 BABIP, which plummeted to .285 last season. The lower batting average, along with the weak Orioles offense, dropped Mancini's RBI to 58, extremely low for a power hitter appearing in 156 games. Curiously, Mancini, a righty swinger, has handled right-handed pitchers much better than southpaws, though it's too early in his career to definitively label him a reverse-splits hitter. Defensively, Mancini is a poor outfielder, and he really should be moved back to first base. Baltimore is still in rebuild mode, so Mancini will be given another season to develop. Look for a rebound in batting average but continued middling production in a porous lineup.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":585.0,"1":149.0,"2":0.254700855,"3":24.0,"4":4.0,"5":24.0,"6":52.0,"7":97.0,"8":253.0,"9":0.432478632,"10":43.0,"11":1.0,"12":6.0,"13":5.0,"14":7.0,"15":2.0,"16":639.0,"17":0.309859155,"18":0.742337787,"19":0.0,"20":71.0,"21":66.0,"22":0.0,"23":1.0,"24":0.0,"25":1.0,"26":16.0,"27":158.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":157.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":26,"statCategoryRanking":148,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.52309483},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":1.5838767},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":1.1710749},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.87325263},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.5976197}],"totalRanking":278,"totalRating":2.5074897}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":32657,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":2,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":4,"rank":203,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[0,12,16,17],"firstName":"Mike","fullName":"Mike Zunino","id":32657,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"10","lastName":"Zunino","lastNewsDate":1547203666000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.8571428571428571,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":229.68287037037038,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":58.333333333333336,"percentStarted":47.093023255813954},"proTeamId":30,"seasonOutlook":"Zunino is a hitter who brings big power but poor contact, therefore walking a fine line between being fantasy-relevant and a liability for our purposes based upon how lucky he is on batted balls and how streaky he's being with his poor contact.

Zunino's strikeout rate, though, is also a position-worst 36.9 percent. He moved to one of the most pitching-friendly environments in baseball this winter in Tampa Bay's Tropicana Field, so home runs might be slightly tougher to come by, too. Zunino should do enough to warrant top-10 catcher status due to the position's lack of depth, but he's one of the more risk/reward backstops and is more of a liability in points-based scoring.

However, last season he displayed some latent pop, giving hope that there's more in his fantasy arsenal to come. As encouraging as his 2018 numbers were, proceed with caution. The underlying metrics don't fully portend a sustained power breakout. Gurriel's hard-hit rate and average exit velocity support his 17.5 HR/FB, but a low average launch angle generates only a 30-percent fly ball rate. Plus, Gurriel has yet to establish a contact rate baseline -- though there are strong indications it will be above-average, albeit with few walks in the mix. Volume is what saves Gurriel, as the keystone in Toronto appears to have his name on it. Plus, he could occupy a spot near the top of the Torontobatting order. There's risk, but Gurriel's ability to put the ball in play should at least offer a batting-average floor, with the hope of some production in the power categories.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":548.0,"1":148.0,"2":0.270072993,"3":25.0,"4":1.0,"5":19.0,"6":45.0,"7":103.0,"8":232.0,"9":0.423357664,"10":19.0,"11":1.0,"12":7.0,"13":8.0,"14":9.0,"15":1.0,"16":583.0,"17":0.298456261,"18":0.721813925,"19":0.0,"20":65.0,"21":89.0,"22":0.0,"23":5.0,"24":5.0,"25":0.0,"26":10.0,"27":123.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":142.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":39,"statCategoryRanking":233,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":0.79790074},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":0.22419488},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.1381924},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.086670734},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.44554687}],"totalRanking":473,"totalRating":0.52502704}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":32900,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":6,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":4,"rank":206,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[4,6,19,8,9,5,12,16,17],"firstName":"Chris","fullName":"Chris Taylor","id":32900,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"3","lastName":"Taylor","lastNewsDate":1547220636000,"lastVideoDate":1540443766000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":1.5714285714285714,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":223.92111368909514,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":64.27184466019418,"percentStarted":43.883495145631066},"proTeamId":19,"seasonOutlook":"Taylor has continued his conversion from a line-drive hitter to one who tries to drive the ball over the fence.

A decline of five percentage points in his strikeout rate was a contributing factor to his 34-point drop in batting average from 2017, but the larger factor was his output against southpaws. Taylor hit .297 against lefties in 2017 as he broke out, but he hit just .232 last season in 214 plate appearances, seeing his BABIP against them drop nearly 120 points. He begins this season eligible at both shortstop and outfield, and he should pick up one or two positions during the season.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":509.0,"1":131.0,"2":0.257367387,"3":32.0,"4":7.0,"5":15.0,"6":54.0,"7":77.0,"8":222.0,"9":0.436149312,"10":51.0,"11":0.0,"12":8.0,"13":3.0,"14":3.0,"15":0.0,"16":571.0,"17":0.332749562,"18":0.768898875,"19":0.0,"20":80.0,"21":62.0,"22":0.0,"23":12.0,"24":6.0,"25":6.0,"26":9.0,"27":156.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":147.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":19,"statCategoryRanking":92,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":0.09793582},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":0.85174036},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":1.7082101},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":1.0442487},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":0.77103615}],"totalRanking":151,"totalRating":4.473171}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":28639,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":5,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":4,"rank":207,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[3,7,19,12,16,17],"firstName":"Evan","fullName":"Evan Longoria","id":28639,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"10","lastName":"Longoria","lastNewsDate":1537978600000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.8571428571428571,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":230.74709976798144,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":53.980582524271846,"percentStarted":18.446601941747574},"proTeamId":26,"seasonOutlook":"Looking for stability at the hot corner, the Giants acquired Longoria from the Rays last winter.

In mid-June, Longoria was hit on the left hand, requiring surgery to mend the fracture. During his rehab stint, he was drilled on the triceps, delaying his return until late July. AT&T Park should have helped Longoria's average while costing him some power. The opposite occurred, though, as his ISO inched up while his batting average slid to .244, matching his 2011 mark for a personal low. Longoria's plate skills also dipped, as his 0.22 BB/K was the poorest of his career. Finally, his once-stellar defense continued to decline.

Later traded to the Tampa Bay Rays in the Chris Archer deal, Meadows got only a 10 game cup of coffee for his new team, though they certainly see a bright future ahead and should clear a regular outfield role for him in the early stages of the year -- his service time situation probably ultimately dictating his promotion date. He brings an appealing combination of power and speed, a 15/20 type who is capable enough with the bat to contribute across the board in rotisserie.

It was the best possible outcome he could've expected, and put him in the lead for starting first base duties entering spring training, which keeps him on the AL-only and deep-mixed radar.

So long as he can hold onto the job, he should put forth numbers worthy of the mixed league corner infield tier.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":392.0,"1":108.0,"2":0.275510204,"3":21.0,"4":1.0,"5":21.0,"6":43.0,"7":65.0,"8":194.0,"9":0.494897959,"10":37.0,"11":1.0,"12":7.0,"13":1.0,"14":1.0,"15":0.0,"16":437.0,"17":0.347826087,"18":0.842724046,"19":0.0,"20":53.0,"21":62.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":1.0,"25":-1.0,"26":8.0,"27":102.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":120.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":25,"statCategoryRanking":211,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":1.1523131},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":0.6425585},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.1381924},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.12086995},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.5976197}],"totalRanking":405,"totalRating":1.1799295}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":32362,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":8,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":4,"rank":213,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[9,5,12,16,17],"firstName":"Jackie","fullName":"Jackie Bradley Jr.","id":32362,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"19","lastName":"Bradley Jr.","ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.8571428571428571,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":225.34953703703704,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":55.62015503875969,"percentStarted":30.03875968992248},"proTeamId":2,"seasonOutlook":"Bradley is an elite defender, and it is that defense that kept him in the major leagues all season.

He was essentially a league-average hitter for the first two months, but things clicked in June as he started to do a lot of damage when he connected, hitting 15 homers in 318 plate appearances from June 1 on while posting a .281/.354/.547 line during that span. He was also more active on the basepaths during the final four months, finishing 12-of-14 as a base stealer. The final results included a career-high walk rate (11.4 percent), OBP (.340), slugging percentage (.499) and home run total (23), with a fly ball rate that was 10 percentage points higher than his career 38.0 percent mark. Unfortunately, his season came to a premature end when he dislocated his shoulder in early September. The surgery required the repair of torn cartilage in his labrum and his timetable for a return could extend into May or June, depending on how he progresses through his rehab work.

He's first base, second base, shortstop and outfield eligible in ESPN leagues, which could be a big help with his signing team because of his ability to handle a multitude of roles. Still, Gonzalez regressed significantly as a hitter last season, following up his .299/.363/.485 second-half triple slash rates from the second half of 2017, which showed a downturn from his start of that year as is, with .247/.324/.409 rates in 2018. There's value in a player like this, a swiss-army-knife type who logs enough playing time to make his counting numbers register while serving a handy plug-in all around a mixed league roster, though it's more so in the mid-to-late rounds than sooner in your draft.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":455.0,"1":122.0,"2":0.268131868,"3":28.0,"4":2.0,"5":16.0,"6":46.0,"7":76.0,"8":202.0,"9":0.443956044,"10":45.0,"11":3.0,"12":3.0,"13":2.0,"14":6.0,"15":4.0,"16":509.0,"17":0.333988212,"18":0.777944256,"19":0.0,"20":58.0,"21":67.0,"22":0.0,"23":5.0,"24":4.0,"25":1.0,"26":9.0,"27":107.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":134.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":28,"statCategoryRanking":153,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.2097208},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":0.74714947},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":0.90250725},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":1.2152448},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.293474}],"totalRanking":291,"totalRating":2.3617067}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":32512,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":6,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":3,"rank":224,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[2,4,6,19,12,16,17],"firstName":"Ketel","fullName":"Ketel Marte","id":32512,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"4","lastName":"Marte","lastNewsDate":1548096683000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.5714285714285714,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":241.65429234338748,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":44.85436893203884,"percentStarted":17.66990291262136},"proTeamId":29,"seasonOutlook":"Marte, more of a baserunning/defense prospect at the time of his 2015 big-league debut, finally began to show some signs of growth with the bat when given regular playing time by the Arizona Diamondbacks last season.

Marte would need to improve his hitting from the left side of the plate to take another significant step forward, as he slashed just .224/.300/.352 against them in 2018, but he's likely to get the chance to with regular at-bats on a rebuilding Diamondbacks team.

Braun's fortunes changed after the break, and he hit .281 while posting an .879 OPS the rest of the regular season. Braun's days of being an everyday player are in the past, but fewer games are seemingly a benefit in his case, as it keeps him fresher and more productive when he is on the field. He isn't the fantasy anchor he used to be, but he's certainly more than roster filler still. Braun turned 35 during the winter, so it's unlikely he will play more than the 125 games he played in 2018 in what was a relatively healthy season. However, he's still going to get at-bats when he's not injured, and will hit in the top portion of the order when he plays. With Christian Yelich and Lorenzo Cain finishing third and fourth, respectively, in the NL in OBP last season, Braun will have plenty opportunities to knock in runs, particularly if his offseason attempt to increase his launch angle pays off.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":392.0,"1":104.0,"2":0.265306122,"3":23.0,"4":1.0,"5":19.0,"6":43.0,"7":61.0,"8":186.0,"9":0.474489796,"10":34.0,"11":3.0,"12":2.0,"13":3.0,"14":3.0,"15":0.0,"16":431.0,"17":0.324825986,"18":0.799315782,"19":0.0,"20":56.0,"21":60.0,"22":0.0,"23":11.0,"24":5.0,"25":6.0,"26":8.0,"27":80.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":112.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":16,"statCategoryRanking":98,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":0.10267504},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":1.1655132},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":0.8353653},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":1.0784479},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":1.075182}],"totalRanking":163,"totalRating":4.2571836}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000}]}
