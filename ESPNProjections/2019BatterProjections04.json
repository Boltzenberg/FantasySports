The veteran infielder followed up a 153-game campaign by playing in 157 contests last season. Lowrie was a great veteran presence on an up-and-and coming Oakland club, stabilizing a lineup with a lot of swing-and-miss. His 122 wRC+ was his highest as a full-time player. His 18.8 percent strikeout rate, while still below average, was the highest it's been since 2009, though Lowrie's 11.5 percent walk rate was his best since 2010.  Lowrie signed with the Mets this offseason, and it's likely he will see action at multiple positions after almost exclusively playing second base in 2018. The switch-hitter handles right-handed pitchers better than southpaws, and showed improved defense at the keystone last season, two things that bode well for his continuing to see ample playing time.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":540.0,"1":142.0,"2":0.262962963,"3":32.0,"4":1.0,"5":17.0,"6":50.0,"7":92.0,"8":227.0,"9":0.42037037,"10":71.0,"11":1.0,"12":3.0,"13":3.0,"14":3.0,"15":0.0,"16":617.0,"17":0.350081037,"18":0.770451408,"19":0.0,"20":73.0,"21":79.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":8.0,"27":113.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":144.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":8,"statCategoryRanking":72,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":0.83311665},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":1.4792858},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":1.4732134},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":2.2754204},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.5976197}],"totalRanking":118,"totalRating":5.463417}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":28671,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":6,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":3,"rank":227,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[2,3,4,6,7,19,12,16,17],"firstName":"Asdrubal","fullName":"Asdrubal Cabrera","id":28671,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"13","lastName":"Cabrera","lastNewsDate":1548148515000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.5714285714285714,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":219.47331786542924,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":59.22330097087379,"percentStarted":28.349514563106798},"proTeamId":13,"seasonOutlook":"Cabrera now has 12 major-league seasons under his belt, and with that experience comes some rather stable skills. He has never been the type of player to be drafted for upside, as he has rarely displayed it. However, sometimes he exceeds his high floor, as he did last season with his power production rebounding back to previously established levels. Cabrera has posted a HR/FB above 10 percent three times in his career, and each of those seasons resulted in 20-plus homers. What he has not yet done is reach those marks in back-to-back seasons. A five-point jump in strikeout rate says he may have been trading contact for power as he was heading into free agency. After signing with the Rangers, Cabrera is expected to play mostly at third base in 2019. The park boost and multi-positional eligibility (2B, SS, 3B) add to his appeal.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":519.0,"1":151.0,"2":0.290944123,"3":37.0,"4":1.0,"5":23.0,"6":61.0,"7":90.0,"8":259.0,"9":0.499036609,"10":44.0,"11":1.0,"12":3.0,"13":2.0,"14":3.0,"15":1.0,"16":569.0,"17":0.34797891,"18":0.847015519,"19":0.0,"20":77.0,"21":79.0,"22":0.0,"23":2.0,"24":0.0,"25":2.0,"26":15.0,"27":100.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":142.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":20,"statCategoryRanking":106,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":0.52545106},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":1.4792858},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":1.1375039},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":1.4546393},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.5976197}],"totalRanking":180,"totalRating":3.9992602}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":34968,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":3,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":3,"rank":228,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[1,7,19,12,16,17,11],"firstName":"Tyler","fullName":"Tyler White","id":34968,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"13","lastName":"White","lastNewsDate":1539868767000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.14285714285714285,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":254.8310185185185,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":17.829457364341085,"percentStarted":7.170542635658915},"proTeamId":18,"seasonOutlook":"After failing to impress in six previous big-league cups of coffee in a two-and-a-half-year span, White finally broke through after a July 29 promotion last summer, batting .287/.350/.551 with 10 home runs and 39 RBIs in 51 games while shifting between first base and designated hitter. It wasn't a performance far off his career rates at the Triple-A level (.311/.399/.539), but it's worth remembering that he's a mediocre defender who had ridden the minors-to-majors shuttle for quite some time, in an organization rich in talent which also values defense. White could be the favorite for DH at-bats for the Astros entering 2019, but he's a dangerous investment as any more than a mid-range mixed league corner infielder, as his 68-point career wOBA righty/lefty split hints he might be best suited for platoon play, and on the weak side in that event.

To be fair, Grichuk got off to a horrendous start with his new club, slashing just .106/.208/.227 after one month. He then missed a month with a Grade 1 PCL strain in his left knee. After returning on June 1, though, Grichuk raked the rest of the season, registering a .274/.323/.559 line, including 23 long balls. Grichuk's defense slipped a tad, but that could partly be due in part to his getting used to new ballparks, particularly his own. With good health, Grichuk is in a prime spot to carry over last season's second-half performance.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":439.0,"1":108.0,"2":0.246013667,"3":32.0,"4":2.0,"5":26.0,"6":60.0,"7":48.0,"8":222.0,"9":0.505694761,"10":27.0,"11":1.0,"12":6.0,"13":3.0,"14":3.0,"15":0.0,"16":475.0,"17":0.296842105,"18":0.802536866,"19":0.0,"20":64.0,"21":67.0,"22":0.0,"23":4.0,"24":2.0,"25":2.0,"26":7.0,"27":131.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":128.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":16,"statCategoryRanking":128,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.27946693},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":1.6884676},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":0.86893624},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.9758503},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.1414011}],"totalRanking":238,"totalRating":3.1123862}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":33776,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":5,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":3,"rank":233,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[3,7,19,10,5,12,16,17],"firstName":"Brian","fullName":"Brian Anderson","id":33776,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"15","lastName":"Anderson","lastNewsDate":1549738679000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.2857142857142857,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":234.9048723897912,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":54.56310679611651,"percentStarted":41.359223300970875},"proTeamId":28,"seasonOutlook":"Anderson was granted a chance to play regularly as a rookie for the rebuilding Miami Marlins last season, and a prominent role coupled with a massive amount of playing time fueled a No. 128 finish in terms of fantasy points and No. 203 on the Player Rater. Unfortunately, counting numbers don't always go hand in hand with skills, and his .332 batting average on balls in play coupled with mere 78.1 percent contact and 52.3 percent ground-ball rates suggest that he was extremely fortunate to finish the year where he did. Anderson, still only 25 years old, could grow somewhat as a hitter in his second full big-league campaign, but he has the skill set of a contact/line-drive oriented type rather than one primed for big-time production. He's more of a high-floor, low-ceiling, lower-tier corner infielder than something more, at least at this stage.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":584.0,"1":151.0,"2":0.258561644,"3":34.0,"4":4.0,"5":13.0,"6":51.0,"7":100.0,"8":232.0,"9":0.397260274,"10":62.0,"11":2.0,"12":16.0,"13":4.0,"14":4.0,"15":0.0,"16":666.0,"17":0.343843844,"18":0.741104118,"19":0.0,"20":90.0,"21":73.0,"22":0.0,"23":2.0,"24":3.0,"25":-1.0,"26":18.0,"27":141.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":159.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":13,"statCategoryRanking":107,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":1.1642638},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":0.22419488},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":1.7753521},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":1.1126472},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.293474}],"totalRanking":182,"totalRating":3.9829838}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":31870,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":9,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":3,"rank":234,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[9,10,5,12,16,17],"firstName":"Max","fullName":"Max Kepler","id":31870,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"26","lastName":"Kepler","lastNewsDate":1550165565000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.2857142857142857,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":226.34722222222223,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":50.775193798449614,"percentStarted":35.65891472868217},"proTeamId":9,"seasonOutlook":"Kepler drew walks at a career-high rate (11.6 percent) and cut his strikeout rate to a career-low 15.7 percent, but he lost nearly 20 points from his batting average and his OBP barely increased (from .312 to .319).

Aided by a change in approach that saw him use more of the field, Franco hit a robust .298/.342/.520 from June onward, featuring an excellent 12.5 K%. Franco missed most of September, though, with nagging neck and shoulder woes. Entering 2019, third base should be Franco's job to lose with Kingery as the main competition.

When Lamb finally made it back six weeks later, he was unable to get in a groove. In late July, Lamb was sidelined again with what was thought to be a left shoulder contusion. Further examination revealed Lamb had been playing through a frayed left rotator cuff, which required season-ending surgery. At least there was a reason for his struggles coming off a pair of nearly identical campaigns. Lamb is expected to make a full recovery before Opening Day, which bodes well for his chances of bouncing back. He will shift across the diamond, and is ticketed for the strong side of a first-base platoon, necessitated by his weak .572 OPS versus southpaws since 2016. Lamb has posted an impressive .883 mark facing right-handers over the same period, so he will get his at-bats if he stays healthy.

Typically a contact-oriented batsman during his minor league career, he posted a miserable 68.5 percent contact rate over his final 100 games, during which time he slashed .201/.293/.332. A wrist injury that cost him a mid-May trip to the disabled list might at least partly explain the slump, but Candelario has a lot of work to do restoring his contact rep in order to recapture any mixed-league fantasy appeal. He simply lacks the high-level batting average or power upside necessary to be more than a low-end corner infielder, though at least he should get plenty of time to adjust in the majors rather than minors since his Tigers are rebuilding.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":586.0,"1":133.0,"2":0.226962457,"3":34.0,"4":4.0,"5":20.0,"6":58.0,"7":75.0,"8":235.0,"9":0.401023891,"10":65.0,"11":1.0,"12":8.0,"13":4.0,"14":5.0,"15":1.0,"16":663.0,"17":0.310708899,"18":0.71173279,"19":0.0,"20":76.0,"21":66.0,"22":0.0,"23":2.0,"24":2.0,"25":0.0,"26":6.0,"27":170.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":158.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":24,"statCategoryRanking":186,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":-1.4110945},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":1.0609221},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":1.4732134},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.7364558},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.1414011}],"totalRanking":353,"totalRating":1.7180959}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":6478,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":9,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":2,"rank":240,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[10,5,12,16,17],"firstName":"Nick","fullName":"Nick Markakis","id":6478,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"22","lastName":"Markakis","lastNewsDate":1548159954000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":2.4285714285714284,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":176.6450116009281,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":74.75728155339806,"percentStarted":66.79611650485437},"proTeamId":15,"seasonOutlook":"Throughout his 13-year career, Markakis has been the prototypical compiler, a player whose primary skills are putting the ball in play and durability.

While it's foolish to extrapolate those numbers over a full, healthy season, he's quite the intriguing fantasy prospect should he prove himself recovered enough during spring training to lock down a regular job in the Cincinnati Reds' outfield. Winker possesses elite strike-zone judgment -- among players with at least 300 plate appearances last season, he finished in the 97th percentile in terms of chase rate (swing rate on pitches outside the strike zone) and 93rd in swinging-strike rate -- and finally seemed to be getting a hint of lift on the ball before getting hurt. Outside of injury risk related to his rehab, struggles against left-handed pitchers is about the only other significant strike against him, but even if he's a platoon man in 2019 his rates should be good enough to propel him into the mixed-league tiers.

This has caused his batting average to plummet, making him susceptible to huge slumps, and is going to require some adjustments in order for Happ to recapture the promising power he flashed in his first calendar year in the big leagues. He's a key player to monitor for improvement during spring training, but he also comes with a lot of risk in fantasy, because of the Cubs' team matchups tendencies as well as their depth, which will keep them impatient with him anytime he struggles.

The decline in stolen-base performance was actually more troublesome than his down year with the bat, but if he's looking good running during spring training, he could be a worthwhile lower-tier power/speed pick for the final rounds of your draft.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":452.0,"1":113.0,"2":0.25,"3":21.0,"4":8.0,"5":8.0,"6":37.0,"7":76.0,"8":174.0,"9":0.384955752,"10":28.0,"11":2.0,"12":1.0,"13":5.0,"14":6.0,"15":1.0,"16":487.0,"17":0.291581109,"18":0.676536861,"19":0.0,"20":48.0,"21":41.0,"22":0.0,"23":13.0,"24":9.0,"25":4.0,"26":7.0,"27":84.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":122.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":20,"statCategoryRanking":177,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.3070603},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.08957786},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":0.5332267},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.63385814},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":1.075182}],"totalRanking":335,"totalRating":1.8456286}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":34108,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":9,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":2,"rank":247,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[8,10,5,12,16,17,11],"firstName":"Daniel","fullName":"Daniel Palka","id":34108,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"18","lastName":"Palka","lastNewsDate":1550414909000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":255.93287037037038,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":12.984496124031008,"percentStarted":9.108527131782946},"proTeamId":4,"seasonOutlook":"Palka was summoned from Triple-A Charlotte in late April when Avisail Garcia was sidelined.

Pillar will be in the lineup every day when healthy because of his outstanding defense. That extra playing time allows him to compile production across the board, but he does so from the bottom of the lineup because he is trending into Alcides Escobar territory in OBP.

As Wendle is likely to post decent batting average and on-base numbers that'll fuel a good number of steals, he's one of those players who makes for an ideal round-out-your-mixed-league-roster selection.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":477.0,"1":127.0,"2":0.266247379,"3":28.0,"4":6.0,"5":7.0,"6":41.0,"7":86.0,"8":188.0,"9":0.394129979,"10":28.0,"11":2.0,"12":9.0,"13":7.0,"14":9.0,"15":2.0,"16":522.0,"17":0.314176245,"18":0.708306224,"19":0.0,"20":59.0,"21":54.0,"22":0.0,"23":13.0,"24":4.0,"25":9.0,"26":11.0,"27":100.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":129.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":7,"statCategoryRanking":64,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":2.2882912},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.19416878},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":0.9360782},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.9758503},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":1.8355463}],"totalRanking":108,"totalRating":5.841597}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":35578,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":8,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":1,"rank":253,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[9,5,12,16,17],"firstName":"Cedric","fullName":"Cedric Mullins","id":35578,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"3","lastName":"Mullins","lastNewsDate":1537638725000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":259.41435185185185,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":8.333333333333334,"percentStarted":4.844961240310077},"proTeamId":1,"seasonOutlook":"Thrust into a starting role for the Baltimore Orioles during the final seven weeks of 2018, Mullins couldn't match the success stealing bases that he enjoyed in the minors, going 2-for-5 on his attempts after successfully swiping 81.1 percent and averaging 19 successful steals in the minor leagues.

However, for the fourth time since 2011, Cervelli missed some time due to a concussion. Even though it was his first incident since 2015, Cervelli is in even more peril than the typical backstop, due to the cumulative effect of his head injuries. Aside from the potential of a foul-tip ending his season (if not his career), Cervelli has always been a competent fantasy catcher, providing a stable batting-average floor with solid patience and contact skills. His ability to work walks elevates his value in OBP and points formats. Last season, a huge spike in flyball rate (41 percent) along with his highest HR/FB rate since 2013 (11.4 percent) added power. Not only is Cervelli a candidate for regression, he's in danger of losing playing time to Elias Diaz. Cervelli is best suited for two-catcher formats.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":384.0,"1":99.0,"2":0.2578125,"3":18.0,"4":3.0,"5":10.0,"6":31.0,"7":68.0,"8":153.0,"9":0.3984375,"10":56.0,"11":1.0,"12":12.0,"13":3.0,"14":4.0,"15":1.0,"16":456.0,"17":0.36622807,"18":0.76466557,"19":0.0,"20":48.0,"21":57.0,"22":0.0,"23":3.0,"24":3.0,"25":0.0,"26":7.0,"27":94.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":119.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":9,"statCategoryRanking":203,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":0.25158545},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":0.32878578},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":0.1639462},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.83905345},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.293474}],"totalRanking":388,"totalRating":1.289897}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":33546,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":4,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":1,"rank":255,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[2,6,19,12,16,17,8,5],"firstName":"Adam","fullName":"Adam Frazier","id":33546,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"26","lastName":"Frazier","lastNewsDate":1545382452000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.14285714285714285,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":249.0092807424594,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":21.941747572815533,"percentStarted":12.233009708737864},"proTeamId":23,"seasonOutlook":"Frazier stepped into a semi-regular role with the Pirates early on after Josh Harrison broke his hand, but the 27-year-old failed to take advantage of the opportunity and was ultimately sent to the minors in June after hitting .237/.318/.356 through his first 56 appearances.

Pederson has a strong chance to hit at least 25 homers for the fourth time in five years, albeit with no speed and a middling average, whether he plays in Los Angeles or elsewhere in 2019.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":440.0,"1":105.0,"2":0.238636364,"3":29.0,"4":2.0,"5":25.0,"6":56.0,"7":49.0,"8":213.0,"9":0.484090909,"10":52.0,"11":2.0,"12":5.0,"13":3.0,"14":5.0,"15":2.0,"16":502.0,"17":0.322709163,"18":0.806800072,"19":0.0,"20":73.0,"21":68.0,"22":0.0,"23":3.0,"24":5.0,"25":-2.0,"26":6.0,"27":107.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":147.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":22,"statCategoryRanking":133,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.1501745},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":1.6884676},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":1.0367911},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.8048542},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.44554687}],"totalRanking":248,"totalRating":2.9343915}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":33248,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":2,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":1,"rank":263,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[0,12,16,17],"firstName":"Francisco","fullName":"Francisco Mejia","id":33248,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"27","lastName":"Mejia","lastNewsDate":1538305361000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":257.67749419953594,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":13.398058252427184,"percentStarted":7.961165048543689},"proTeamId":25,"seasonOutlook":"One of the top \"catcher\" prospects in all of baseball, Mejia has yet to break through at the major league level, in part because of questions about his defense behind the plate that explain those quotations, and in part because he has now played in two organizations that preferred the defensive contributions of their incumbent starters. Austin Hedges might not have the bat that Mejia does, but he's a more well-rounded catcher and therefore still a big part of the San Diego Padres' game plan, meaning that Mejia might have to fight for a role as his backup or as a utilityman all year, if he's not destined for another year in Triple-A. Given the chance to play regularly, though, Mejia's minor league history of good contact and line-drive rates would make him one of the strongest fantasy picks at his position, a potential top-five player in the best-case scenario considering the dearth of talent at catcher. He's a strong dynasty/keeper pick because of his hitting skills, though the risk in those is that he'll shift to a deeper position.

He battled a balky back and sore hip for much of the first half but didn't visit the disabled list until aggravating his hip in mid-June, keeping him out for two months. The health issues took their tool, as Bruce's hard-hit rate suffered, with his HR/FB dovetailing. On the other hand, Bruce's walk rate was a career best while his strikeout rate was his lowest since 2009. Health permitting, Bruce lines up for a rebound after an offseason trade landed him in Seattle, where T-Mobile Field (formerly Safeco Field) is more homer-friendly to lefty swingers than Citi Field. Where Bruce plays is unclear, as the Mariners have a logjam at first base, corner outfield and designated hitter. He'll no doubt play a lot, with his dual first base/outfield eligibility coming in handy.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":499.0,"1":121.0,"2":0.24248497,"3":28.0,"4":3.0,"5":25.0,"6":56.0,"7":65.0,"8":230.0,"9":0.460921844,"10":55.0,"11":3.0,"12":2.0,"13":5.0,"14":5.0,"15":0.0,"16":561.0,"17":0.317290553,"18":0.778212396,"19":0.0,"20":66.0,"21":83.0,"22":0.0,"23":3.0,"24":2.0,"25":1.0,"26":9.0,"27":125.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":140.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":40,"statCategoryRanking":307,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.98687345},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":0.01501305},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.10462145},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.15506916},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.293474}],"totalRanking":701,"totalRating":-1.2148867}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":30901,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":3,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":1,"rank":267,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[1,7,19,12,16,17],"firstName":"Brandon","fullName":"Brandon Belt","id":30901,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"9","lastName":"Belt","lastNewsDate":1537542340000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":1.8571428571428572,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":256.92111368909514,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":12.62135922330097,"percentStarted":8.932038834951456},"proTeamId":26,"seasonOutlook":"For the second consecutive season, Belt missed about two months of action, but at least it wasn't due to a concussion as in 2017.

After returning for a month, Belt was shut down in mid-September with season-ending knee surgery. When healthy, his ISO was the second lowest of his career, trailing only his sophomore campaign. Statcast data reveals a lower exit velocity and hard-hit rate than normal, likely a result of him playing much of the second half on a balky knee. So long as Belt continues to play half his games in AT&T Park, the pull-hitting left-hander's power will be squashed. His once-sneaky speed has waned with age, too. With continued injury concerns, Belt is a risk in any format.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":417.0,"1":106.0,"2":0.254196643,"3":24.0,"4":3.0,"5":15.0,"6":42.0,"7":64.0,"8":181.0,"9":0.434052758,"10":63.0,"11":4.0,"12":5.0,"13":2.0,"14":2.0,"15":0.0,"16":487.0,"17":0.357289528,"18":0.791342286,"19":0.0,"20":56.0,"21":50.0,"22":0.0,"23":3.0,"24":1.0,"25":2.0,"26":3.0,"27":113.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":117.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":22,"statCategoryRanking":190,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":0.053129807},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":0.5379676},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":0.5332267},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.4628621},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":0.01067178}],"totalRanking":359,"totalRating":1.597858}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":33970,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":3,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":1,"rank":268,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[1,7,19,12,16,17],"firstName":"Ryon","fullName":"Ryon Healy","id":33970,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"27","lastName":"Healy","lastNewsDate":1536966026000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":259.56018518518516,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":10.271317829457365,"percentStarted":6.782945736434108},"proTeamId":12,"seasonOutlook":"Healy has now been in the majors for three seasons, but production-wise, he has been unable to replicate the pace he set as a rookie in 2016.

It stands out more, though, because he plays first base, where the production bar is very high. His splits are mostly neutral, and he can still hit 20 homers with regular playing time, but that playing time will be tough to find as the Seattle roster is rather crowded with players who should DH.

Trumbo had an improved season around the injury, hitting for more power and a better average, but his 2016 level of production looks more like an outlier than something in the range of possibility moving forward. He is in the final year of his deal with Baltimore, which is worrisome because he is a hitter tailor made for the dimensions of Camden Yards. We should safely assume Trumbo will play at least the first half of the season within Baltimore's friendly confines, but the probability of him being dealt away and/or losing playing time will increase as the season wears on. He is essentially a full-time DH, so a trade would almost certainly impact his at-bats.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":509.0,"1":128.0,"2":0.251473477,"3":20.0,"4":0.0,"5":28.0,"6":48.0,"7":80.0,"8":232.0,"9":0.455795678,"10":39.0,"11":0.0,"12":3.0,"13":4.0,"14":4.0,"15":0.0,"16":555.0,"17":0.306306306,"18":0.762101984,"19":0.0,"20":72.0,"21":73.0,"22":0.0,"23":1.0,"24":0.0,"25":1.0,"26":12.0,"27":138.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":137.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":6,"statCategoryRanking":210,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":0.30480683},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":0.85174036},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":0.2310881},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.39446366},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.5976197}],"totalRanking":404,"totalRating":1.1844792}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":33339,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":9,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":1,"rank":272,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[10,5,12,16,17],"firstName":"Franmil","fullName":"Franmil Reyes","id":33339,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"32","lastName":"Reyes","lastNewsDate":1550109034000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":259.2227378190255,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":9.320388349514563,"percentStarted":6.213592233009709},"proTeamId":25,"seasonOutlook":"Reyes' astounding six-week stat line with Triple-A El Paso to begin last season -- .346/.442/.738 triple-slash rates with 14 home runs in 36 games -- earned him a mid-May audition with the San Diego Padres, and while he rode the majors-to-minors shuttle for most of the year, he turned in a .280 batting average, .218 isolated power and 18 home runs.

He is an above-average defensive catcher, but so is his backup, James McCann. Both gloves could demand an equal share of playing time, even if both bats fail to repeat previous levels of production.

Hernandez doesn't even have the kind of lefty-mashing platoon split to be a worthwhile platoon man or daily-league option, so he'll need to earn a regular gig this spring to be worth drafting in deep mixed or AL-only leagues for his home runs.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":462.0,"1":111.0,"2":0.24025974,"3":29.0,"4":5.0,"5":18.0,"6":52.0,"7":59.0,"8":204.0,"9":0.441558442,"10":38.0,"11":0.0,"12":4.0,"13":4.0,"14":5.0,"15":1.0,"16":509.0,"17":0.300589391,"18":0.742147833,"19":0.0,"20":65.0,"21":57.0,"22":0.0,"23":10.0,"24":7.0,"25":3.0,"26":11.0,"27":144.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":129.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":23,"statCategoryRanking":135,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.57769644},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":1.374695},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":1.103933},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.83905345},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":0.16274466}],"totalRanking":250,"totalRating":2.9027297}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":30445,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":2,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":1,"rank":279,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[0,12,16,17],"firstName":"Robinson","fullName":"Robinson Chirinos","id":30445,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"28","lastName":"Chirinos","lastNewsDate":1543930200000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":258.0925925925926,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":7.751937984496124,"percentStarted":6.007751937984496},"proTeamId":18,"seasonOutlook":"Chirinos cracked a career-high 18 homers in 2018, giving him 35 in his past two seasons (735 plate appearances).

The per-game production at the plate is ample for fantasy purposes, but he's more valuable to big league clubs for his defense, which continues to grade out favorably as he moves into his mid-30s. After a six-year stint with the Rangers, Chirinos signed with the Astros as a free agent during the offseason.

Quite frankly, his performance over the past two seasons isn't making the decision any easier. A second baseman by trade, Kipnis has dabbled in the outfield. After hitting 23 homers and notching 15 steals in 2016, Kipnis has slugged just 30 long balls with 13 steals in the following two seasons combined. Further, his batting average is in a three-year tailspin, bottoming out at a career-worst .230 last season. Kipnis' plate skills haven't been the problem. It's a plummeting average exit velocity which is dragging his BABIP down. Last season's 86.1 mph level ranked No. 270 out of 332 hitters with at least 150 batted balls. Still, Kipnis enters 2019 as the Indians' regular second baseman, which will provide plenty of playing time out of the gate. He offers some pop but, unless he begins to hit the ball with more authority, his contributions elsewhere will be limited.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":516.0,"1":126.0,"2":0.244186047,"3":31.0,"4":2.0,"5":18.0,"6":51.0,"7":75.0,"8":215.0,"9":0.416666667,"10":54.0,"11":1.0,"12":5.0,"13":3.0,"14":4.0,"15":1.0,"16":579.0,"17":0.319516408,"18":0.736183074,"19":0.0,"20":66.0,"21":69.0,"22":0.0,"23":9.0,"24":1.0,"25":8.0,"26":4.0,"27":112.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":139.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":19,"statCategoryRanking":140,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":-1.1025221},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":0.95633125},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":1.0367911},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":1.4546393},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":0.46689042}],"totalRanking":257,"totalRating":2.8121297}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":6188,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":10,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":1,"rank":282,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[11,12,16,17],"firstName":"Kendrys","fullName":"Kendrys Morales","id":6188,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"8","lastName":"Morales","lastNewsDate":1537794652000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":259.0671296296296,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":5.436893203883495,"percentStarted":4.077669902912621},"proTeamId":14,"seasonOutlook":"Heading into last season, Morales was a mixed-league afterthought. In 2018, his numbers closely resembled that of 2017, but it doesn't tell the whole story. On June 5, he was slashing .188/.260/.312. However, a 50 percent hard-hit rate in May along with favorable Statcast data foreshadowed an impending breakout. From that point until Aug. 26, Morales raked to the tune of .309/.393/.570, culminating in a historical eight-homers-in-seven-games stretch. Morales then struggled the rest of the season, posting a .458 OPS down the stretch. He's begun each of the past four seasons as utility only, but gained first base eligibility in season, playing 18 games at the position last summer. Morales will again be the Blue Jays' primary designated hitter, though he'll likely get more off days than he did in his younger days. While he's more than an afterthought, Morales is still best suited for deeper formats.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":422.0,"1":107.0,"2":0.253554502,"3":17.0,"4":0.0,"5":23.0,"6":40.0,"7":67.0,"8":193.0,"9":0.457345972,"10":42.0,"11":3.0,"12":3.0,"13":3.0,"14":3.0,"15":0.0,"16":470.0,"17":0.323404255,"18":0.780750227,"19":0.0,"20":49.0,"21":63.0,"22":0.0,"23":1.0,"24":2.0,"25":-1.0,"26":12.0,"27":98.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":123.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":5,"statCategoryRanking":162,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.10165662},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":1.270104},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":0.43251383},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.83905345},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.293474}],"totalRanking":306,"totalRating":2.1465406}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":28476,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":7,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":1,"rank":284,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[8,10,5,12,16,17],"firstName":"Matt","fullName":"Matt Kemp","id":28476,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"27","lastName":"Kemp","lastNewsDate":1545399827000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.14285714285714285,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":251.02088167053364,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":24.271844660194176,"percentStarted":16.699029126213592},"proTeamId":17,"seasonOutlook":"Kemp enjoyed his best offensive season since 2014 with a resurgence at the plate, thanks in big part to him getting more loft to the ball.

He's an especially useful pick in leagues that allow daily transactions, and he should hit for enough power to help AL-only teams as a corner infielder.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":441.0,"1":112.0,"2":0.253968254,"3":17.0,"4":1.0,"5":26.0,"6":44.0,"7":68.0,"8":209.0,"9":0.473922902,"10":63.0,"11":5.0,"12":3.0,"13":4.0,"14":4.0,"15":0.0,"16":511.0,"17":0.348336595,"18":0.822259497,"19":0.0,"20":59.0,"21":82.0,"22":0.0,"23":2.0,"24":0.0,"25":2.0,"26":12.0,"27":119.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":139.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":24,"statCategoryRanking":206,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":-1.0604811},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":1.1655132},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":0.49965575},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.90745187},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.293474}],"totalRanking":399,"totalRating":1.2186657}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":30452,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":3,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":1,"rank":288,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[1,7,19,12,16,17],"firstName":"Mitch","fullName":"Mitch Moreland","id":30452,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"18","lastName":"Moreland","lastNewsDate":1540735114000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":258.01851851851853,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":6.2015503875969,"percentStarted":4.069767441860465},"proTeamId":2,"seasonOutlook":"Moreland has earned the nickname Mitchie Twobags in Boston because of his propensity to hit doubles.

The StatCast data shows that his overall numbers have significantly underperformed the quality of his contact in each of the past three seasons. In 2018, he had a top-40 average exit velocity and had more barrels per PA than the likes of Francisco Lindor and Rhys Hoskins.

Flowers is coming off a season in which he crushed lefties, recording an unsustainable 1.117 OPS with the platoon advantage. Chances are, like Flowers did with Suzuki, he and McCann will split catching duties pretty evenly, putting Flowers in play in two-catcher formats.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":322.0,"1":79.0,"2":0.245341615,"3":14.0,"4":0.0,"5":11.0,"6":25.0,"7":54.0,"8":126.0,"9":0.391304348,"10":37.0,"11":0.0,"12":12.0,"13":1.0,"14":2.0,"15":1.0,"16":373.0,"17":0.343163539,"18":0.734467887,"19":0.0,"20":37.0,"21":39.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":8.0,"27":92.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":101.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":30,"statCategoryRanking":320,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.67834586},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.08957786},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.00390858},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.084325336},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.5976197}],"totalRanking":748,"totalRating":-1.4537773}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":30632,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":9,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":1,"rank":295,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[10,5,12,16,17],"firstName":"Steven","fullName":"Steven Souza Jr.","id":30632,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"28","lastName":"Souza Jr.","lastNewsDate":1547202088000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":259.5475638051044,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":8.737864077669903,"percentStarted":6.213592233009709},"proTeamId":29,"seasonOutlook":"Souza's 2019 season was very much abbreviated by a pectoral strain that twice landed him on the disabled list for two-month stints. He initially injured it late in spring training and did it again within three weeks of his first return. Souza, when healthy, has the skills to be a 20-20 player, albeit with a low batting average because of poor contact skills. The problem has been he has really only had one healthy season at the big-league level. One encouraging sign for Souza was improvement in terms of handling hard stuff, hitting a career-best .261 against fastballs. However, he also hit a career-worst .214 against all non-fastballs, with a 20 percent swinging strike rate. 2017 shows what Souza is capable of when he stays on the field, but six DL stints over the past four seasons cannot be ignored.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":518.0,"1":122.0,"2":0.235521236,"3":26.0,"4":4.0,"5":20.0,"6":50.0,"7":72.0,"8":216.0,"9":0.416988417,"10":65.0,"11":1.0,"12":6.0,"13":0.0,"14":1.0,"15":1.0,"16":590.0,"17":0.327118644,"18":0.744107061,"19":0.0,"20":65.0,"21":67.0,"22":0.0,"23":13.0,"24":4.0,"25":9.0,"26":7.0,"27":169.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":150.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":42,"statCategoryRanking":325,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.84437734},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.4033506},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.440331},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.11852455},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":0.31481755}],"totalRanking":754,"totalRating":-1.491766}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":33241,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":3,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":1,"rank":296,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[1,7,19,12,16,17],"firstName":"Ronald","fullName":"Ronald Guzman","id":33241,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"67","lastName":"Guzman","lastNewsDate":1538233779000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":259.6412037037037,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":5.62015503875969,"percentStarted":4.457364341085271},"proTeamId":13,"seasonOutlook":"Guzman reached the majors early last season but didn't show any more power or hit for any higher batting average than he did during his minor league career, concerns because he plays the relatively deep first base position.

Initially, the plan was for Nunez to play second base until Dustin Pedroia was back, then revert to his customary utility role, often giving Rafael Devers a day off with a tough lefty on the hill. Since Nunez was coming off of knee surgery, he limited his running, especially early while also occasionally ceding the keystone to Brock Holt. Once Pedroia was ruled out for the season, Nunez split time at second with Holt while also spelling Devers at the hot corner. Other than a short stretch in the middle of the season when his knee felt good, Nunez rarely ran. His power also suffered. Nunez begins 2019 in a similar boat as 2018: Pedroia insurance, perhaps behind Holt. Nunez is playable only in AL-only leagues where his dual eligibility boosts his value.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":417.0,"1":119.0,"2":0.285371703,"3":22.0,"4":2.0,"5":10.0,"6":34.0,"7":85.0,"8":175.0,"9":0.419664269,"10":16.0,"11":0.0,"12":2.0,"13":2.0,"14":3.0,"15":1.0,"16":438.0,"17":0.312785388,"18":0.732449657,"19":0.0,"20":51.0,"21":44.0,"22":0.0,"23":15.0,"24":4.0,"25":11.0,"26":12.0,"27":58.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":106.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":21,"statCategoryRanking":155,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":0.6016762},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":0.11960396},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":0.73465246},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.39446366},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":0.46689042}],"totalRanking":295,"totalRating":2.3172867}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000}]}
