Keep in mind that while PNC Park isn't as homer-friendly for left-handed batters as Minute Maid Park, it stealthily plays a tick over neutral. Plus, Bucs batters play almost 20 games in Miller Park and Great American Ball Park. Moran's plate skills came as advertised, but he didn't hit the ball with much authority, sporting a lower-than-expected average exit velocity along with an average launch angle, generating fly balls at a low 29.2 percent clip. Moran wasn't afforded many chances to face southpaws, and a .503 OPS in those situations isn't going to force the club's hand. Moran is likely to again hit mainly against righties with Jung Ho Kang facing lefties. There's latent upside, but not the kind worth chasing.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":456.0,"1":116.0,"2":0.254385965,"3":18.0,"4":1.0,"5":12.0,"6":31.0,"7":85.0,"8":172.0,"9":0.377192982,"10":38.0,"11":3.0,"12":3.0,"13":6.0,"14":7.0,"15":1.0,"16":503.0,"17":0.312127237,"18":0.689320219,"19":0.0,"20":51.0,"21":63.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":3.0,"25":-3.0,"26":7.0,"27":105.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":137.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":20,"statCategoryRanking":168,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":1.0612762},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":0.22419488},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":0.49965575},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.87325263},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.5976197}],"totalRanking":316,"totalRating":2.0607598}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":31173,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":2,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":301,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[0,12,16,17],"firstName":"Tucker","fullName":"Tucker Barnhart","id":31173,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"16","lastName":"Barnhart","lastNewsDate":1538296414000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":257.9373549883991,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":16.893203883495147,"percentStarted":13.20388349514563},"proTeamId":17,"seasonOutlook":"Barnhart is the poster boy for the \"those that don't hurt you\" tier of fantasy catchers.

Barnhart's counting stats are embellished by volume, as last season he was fourth among backstops in terms of plate appearances and there's no one in-house to challenge him for playing time. Plus, his defense grades out as above average. Some of last season's career-best 522 plate appearances came from the two-hole, which is not likely to repeat, costing him some production.

However, he hit just .236, his lowest average since 2009. Gardner's hard-hit rate has always been well below average, so his BABIP, and hence batting average, are driven more by line drive rate than most hitters. In 2019, it was a career-worst 17.9 percent, predictably yielding a personal-low .272 BABIP. The good news is line drive rate is more descriptive than predictive, so a BABIP regression toward his career .310 mark is likely. Gardner usually produces double-digit homers and steals, falling short only twice since 2013, and both times lagging in long balls. Last year, Gardner succeeded on 16 of 18 stolen-base attempts, indicating the wheels are still a weapon. The Yankees brought Gardner back with the chance to reclaim the left-field spot, which he ceded to Andrew McCutchen last fall. His skills are intact, but the Yankees could still look to upgrade.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":487.0,"1":118.0,"2":0.242299795,"3":19.0,"4":5.0,"5":12.0,"6":36.0,"7":82.0,"8":183.0,"9":0.375770021,"10":59.0,"11":0.0,"12":5.0,"13":4.0,"14":7.0,"15":3.0,"16":558.0,"17":0.326164875,"18":0.701934895,"19":0.0,"20":78.0,"21":41.0,"22":0.0,"23":15.0,"24":3.0,"25":12.0,"26":4.0,"27":101.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":127.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":17,"statCategoryRanking":111,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.81409943},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":0.32878578},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":2.0439198},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.42866287},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":1.8355463}],"totalRanking":195,"totalRating":3.8228152}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":31413,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":9,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":304,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[10,5,12,16,17],"firstName":"Kole","fullName":"Kole Calhoun","id":31413,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"56","lastName":"Calhoun","lastNewsDate":1537372281000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":258.462962962963,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":9.883720930232558,"percentStarted":6.782945736434108},"proTeamId":3,"seasonOutlook":"On the surface, Calhoun appears to have bottomed out at the plate in 2018, and while that was true during the first two months of the season (.145/.195/.179), he turned things around after a DL stint and the subsequent time he took to adjust his swing during his rehab assignment. Once he returned to the Angels in June, Calhoun went on to hit .242/.328/.472 with 18 homers and 46 RBIs the rest of the way (367 plate appearances), posting numbers that more closely resembled his previous output with the Halos, albeit with an elevated strikeout rate (24.5 percent). Don't expect the post-DL power output to be sustained over a full season, but Calhoun finished last season as the Angels' primary leadoff hitter, which gives him an excellent counting stats floor if he's able to stay in that spot for an entire season.

Santana returned to the big leagues in September and had some big hits for the Brewers from then onward, but he never regained the regular job he held down the previous season. With Santana falling to the fringes of the 25-man roster and out of options, the Brewers decided it was time to move on, and sent him to the Mariners in exchange for Ben Gamel and a minor-league pitcher. Santana posted 30 homers and 85 RBIs in 2017, and he's heading to a Seattle team that should have more at-bats open for him in the outfield. T-Mobile Park (formerly Safeco Field) is far less of a hitter's paradise than Miller Park, so it might be a stretch to expect Santana to approach his 2017 numbers. However, he should get far more opportunities to do so than he did a year ago.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":490.0,"1":125.0,"2":0.255102041,"3":24.0,"4":2.0,"5":20.0,"6":46.0,"7":79.0,"8":213.0,"9":0.434693878,"10":61.0,"11":2.0,"12":4.0,"13":5.0,"14":6.0,"15":1.0,"16":561.0,"17":0.338680927,"18":0.773374804,"19":0.0,"20":63.0,"21":63.0,"22":0.0,"23":7.0,"24":2.0,"25":5.0,"26":10.0,"27":195.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":139.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":41,"statCategoryRanking":315,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":0.31925902},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.4033506},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.440331},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.42631748},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.44554687}],"totalRanking":736,"totalRating":-1.3962868}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":33247,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":3,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":308,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[1,7,19,12,16,17],"firstName":"Ryan","fullName":"Ryan McMahon","id":33247,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"24","lastName":"McMahon","lastNewsDate":1534025503000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":261.1902552204176,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":6.601941747572815,"percentStarted":4.271844660194175},"proTeamId":27,"stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":326.0,"1":92.0,"2":0.282208589,"3":22.0,"4":5.0,"5":11.0,"6":38.0,"7":54.0,"8":157.0,"9":0.481595092,"10":25.0,"11":2.0,"12":2.0,"13":2.0,"14":3.0,"15":1.0,"16":356.0,"17":0.334269663,"18":0.815864755,"19":0.0,"20":37.0,"21":46.0,"22":0.0,"23":4.0,"24":3.0,"25":1.0,"26":5.0,"27":90.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":101.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":45,"statCategoryRanking":369,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.40509215},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.4033506},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.5746148},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.4605167},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.44554687}],"totalRanking":966,"totalRating":-2.2891212}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":33667,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":2,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":309,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[0,12,16,17],"firstName":"Mitch","fullName":"Mitch Garver","id":33667,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"18","lastName":"Garver","lastNewsDate":1538168853000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":260.7337962962963,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":4.651162790697675,"percentStarted":4.069767441860465},"proTeamId":9,"seasonOutlook":"Even though he struggled after being called up in August of 2017, Garver broke camp last spring as the Twins' backup to Jason Castro. After Castro was lost for the season a month into the season, Garver was behind the plate about half the time, though his playing time down the stretch was sporadic due to a concussion. For the season, Garver hit a respectable .268, buoyed by a 40.5 percent hard-hit rate. Defensively, Garver struggles, especially in comparison to Castro, who possesses plus receiving skills and is an excellent pitch framer. With Willians Astudillo also in the mix, Garver will be hard-pressed to match last season's 335 plate appearances. Even so, with a solid batting average floor and a bit of pop, Garver is in play in two-catcher formats.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":295.0,"1":76.0,"2":0.257627119,"3":19.0,"4":2.0,"5":9.0,"6":30.0,"7":46.0,"8":126.0,"9":0.427118644,"10":30.0,"11":1.0,"12":1.0,"13":1.0,"14":1.0,"15":0.0,"16":327.0,"17":0.327217125,"18":0.754335769,"19":0.0,"20":37.0,"21":42.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":1.0,"25":-1.0,"26":7.0,"27":76.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":90.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":16,"statCategoryRanking":247,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":0.52753925},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.19416878},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":0.13037524},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.42866287},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.5976197}],"totalRanking":496,"totalRating":0.29478887}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":31446,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":8,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":311,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[9,5,12,16,17],"firstName":"Kevin","fullName":"Kevin Kiermaier","id":31446,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"39","lastName":"Kiermaier","lastNewsDate":1537986155000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":260.8865740740741,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":6.395348837209302,"percentStarted":4.263565891472868},"proTeamId":30,"seasonOutlook":"Normally, the party line on Kiermaier is that he's a solid five-category contributor, but will likely spend some time on the DL thanks to his no-fear approach to fly balls. Entering 2019, Kiermaier's outlook isn't as rosy. Last season, he established new lows across the board, slashing a meek .217/.282/.370. He did manage 10 steals, his fifth-consecutive season reaching double-digits, but with five unsuccessful attempts, his success rate was at its worst since his rookie campaign. Thumb, back and shoulder woes, along with a hairline fracture in his right foot, all relegated Kiermaier to just 88 games, the lowest total in his five-year career. Kiermaier's top-notch defense usually keeps him in the lineup. That said, the Rays have stockpiled capable outfielders, so he will need to rebound with the bat in order to guarantee regular action. All told, he's a risky proposition in mixed leagues.

Shortly after that, though, he tore a ligament in his thumb and was sidelined the next six weeks. In Thames' absence Jesus Aguilar secured the regular job at first base for the Brewers, and Thames had trouble finding playing time the rest of the way. As a result, he hit just nine more home runs, and the sporadic playing time also led to major declines in his batting average and OBP. Thames has one year left on his contract with the Brewers -- and an affordable one at that -- so chances are he stays with Milwaukee for another year. Aguilar hit the 100-RBI mark last season but struggled a bit down the stretch, leaving the door open for Thames to reclaim some playing time in 2019. Still, given his struggles against lefties, the best he can likely hope for is a soft platoon, which will depress his value in leagues that don't use daily lineup changes.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":289.0,"1":67.0,"2":0.23183391,"3":14.0,"4":3.0,"5":19.0,"6":36.0,"7":31.0,"8":144.0,"9":0.498269896,"10":39.0,"11":4.0,"12":3.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":331.0,"17":0.329305136,"18":0.827575032,"19":0.0,"20":50.0,"21":42.0,"22":0.0,"23":5.0,"24":1.0,"25":4.0,"26":4.0,"27":106.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":100.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":32,"statCategoryRanking":227,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.89783317},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":0.74714947},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":0.2310881},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.15506916},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":0.46689042}],"totalRanking":454,"totalRating":0.70236397}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":30466,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":5,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":315,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[3,7,19,12,16,17],"firstName":"Zack","fullName":"Zack Cozart","id":30466,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"7","lastName":"Cozart","lastNewsDate":1550001039000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":260.90277777777777,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":4.651162790697675,"percentStarted":2.9069767441860463},"proTeamId":3,"stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":476.0,"1":119.0,"2":0.25,"3":25.0,"4":4.0,"5":17.0,"6":46.0,"7":73.0,"8":203.0,"9":0.426470588,"10":48.0,"11":0.0,"12":7.0,"13":5.0,"14":6.0,"15":1.0,"16":537.0,"17":0.324022346,"18":0.750492935,"19":0.0,"20":68.0,"21":49.0,"22":0.0,"23":2.0,"24":0.0,"25":2.0,"26":8.0,"27":87.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":126.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":41,"statCategoryRanking":380,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.8203752},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.4033506},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.17176336},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.4947159},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.5976197}],"totalRanking":1013,"totalRating":-2.4878247}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":30469,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":6,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":318,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[4,6,19,12,16,17],"firstName":"Brandon","fullName":"Brandon Crawford","id":30469,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"35","lastName":"Crawford","lastNewsDate":1537978826000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":254.78422273781902,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":12.233009708737864,"percentStarted":7.961165048543689},"proTeamId":26,"seasonOutlook":"Other than a three-year trend of declining power, Crawford has been essentially the same player the past three seasons. However, due to the overall improvement among his shortstop brethren, his standing at the position has slipped from middle-of-the-pack to the low end, at least for fantasy purposes, as his leather remains above average. After peaking with a .205 ISO in 2015, Crawford has posted marks of .156, .151 and .139 the past three seasons. Last season's 36.2 percent hard-hit rate was a personal best, so Crawford's drop in power seems mostly a result of 30.8 percent fly ball clip, his lowest since 2012. Even so, by playing half his games in the newly named Oracle Park, his homers are capped in the teens, with his 21 in 2015 the outlier. If you miss out on one of the young stallions, Crawford remains a safe choice, albeit with no upside.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":549.0,"1":141.0,"2":0.256830601,"3":30.0,"4":3.0,"5":14.0,"6":47.0,"7":94.0,"8":219.0,"9":0.398907104,"10":51.0,"11":8.0,"12":6.0,"13":5.0,"14":5.0,"15":0.0,"16":611.0,"17":0.32405892,"18":0.722966024,"19":0.0,"20":62.0,"21":64.0,"22":0.0,"23":4.0,"24":5.0,"25":-1.0,"26":12.0,"27":122.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":154.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":27,"statCategoryRanking":152,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":0.12305014},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":0.5379676},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":0.96964914},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.7364558},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":0.01067178}],"totalRanking":290,"totalRating":2.3777945}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":32856,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":2,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":319,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[0,12,16,17],"firstName":"Austin","fullName":"Austin Barnes","id":32856,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"15","lastName":"Barnes","lastNewsDate":1540562617000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":260.73085846867747,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":5.242718446601942,"percentStarted":3.6893203883495147},"proTeamId":19,"seasonOutlook":"Barnes' 2018 season was a giant mass of confusion. His strikeout rate went from above average to decidedly below average, his batting average fell 84 points, his average exit velocity dropped two miles per hour, and he stopped hitting fly balls. The expected Statcast numbers saw Barnes could have been even worse than he was based on the quality of his contact. One area in which the struggles stood out was against fastballs, as Barnes went from hitting .301 and slugging .498 against them in 2017 to hitting just .185 and slugging .261 against them in 2018. The only skill that carried over from 2017 was his walk rate, which was only useful to those in OBP leagues. Barnes shared the catching duties with Yasmani Grandal last season and will share again in 2019, this time with Russell Martin. If you believe in a rebound, he should be largely available late in drafts.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":303.0,"1":69.0,"2":0.227722772,"3":13.0,"4":1.0,"5":6.0,"6":20.0,"7":49.0,"8":102.0,"9":0.336633663,"10":43.0,"11":3.0,"12":8.0,"13":1.0,"14":2.0,"15":1.0,"16":356.0,"17":0.337078652,"18":0.673712315,"19":0.0,"20":45.0,"21":30.0,"22":0.0,"23":7.0,"24":4.0,"25":3.0,"26":9.0,"27":80.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":130.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":42,"statCategoryRanking":367,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":-1.0494639},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.50794154},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.071050495},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.63151276},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":0.01067178}],"totalRanking":958,"totalRating":-2.2492967}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":34895,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":6,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":322,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[4,6,19,12,16,17],"firstName":"Dansby","fullName":"Dansby

Therein lies a problem with rostering either. Both catchers are right-handed and can hit, but Suzuki was the better producer of the two over the past two seasons while Gomes is the better glove man. The fact both can hit and there is not a clean statistical platoon advantage to address, could mean a cold streak by either leads to increased playing time for the other that he may never give back. Park factors give Suzuki a boost, as he moves from the 27th-easiest place to hit home runs to the fifth easiest.

The wear and tear accumulated over more than 11,000 MLB plate appearances has understandably taken its toll, and it wouldn't be surprising at all if the Angels opted to reduce his role even further in 2019. Justin Bour was added to serve as the primary first baseman, at least against right-handed pitching, and Ohtani should be cleared for DH duty for a good portion of the season. However, Ohtani is not expected to be ready for Opening Day while he rehabs his pitching elbow following Tommy John surgery, which could afford Pujols extra opportunities early

Garcia posted an unsupported .392 BABIP in 2017, the regression monster was fixing to rear its ugly head. Mission accomplished and then some, as Garcia's 2018 mark was a career-low .271. However, Garcia's HR/FB rose to a personal-best 21.3 percent, resulting in a career-high 19 homers, despite playing in only 90 games. Garcia hurt his hamstring in late April, costing him two months on the DL. He aggravated it in July, forcing a shorter, 11-day visit. In mid-September, Garcia was shut down with a sore knee, requiring arthroscopic knee surgery after the season. After being non-tendered by the White Sox, Garcia signed with the Rays where he lines up to be a reserve outfielder, though he could slug his way into the short side of the platoon at designated hitter, making him viable in AL-only formats.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":383.0,"1":100.0,"2":0.261096606,"3":15.0,"4":3.0,"5":17.0,"6":35.0,"7":65.0,"8":172.0,"9":0.449086162,"10":25.0,"11":2.0,"12":5.0,"13":3.0,"14":3.0,"15":0.0,"16":416.0,"17":0.3125,"18":0.761586162,"19":0.0,"20":53.0,"21":55.0,"22":0.0,"23":3.0,"24":2.0,"25":1.0,"26":9.0,"27":102.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":102.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":27,"statCategoryRanking":201,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.5871816},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":1.0609221},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":0.43251383},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.5654597},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.1414011}],"totalRanking":384,"totalRating":1.3303131}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":34878,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":2,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":337,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[0,12,16,17],"firstName":"Willians","fullName":"Willians

has had a 13-year career at the big-league level and has but once failed to produce double-digit totals in both home runs and steals, and that came in 2018, when he fell a home run short. Kinsler has had a lengthy career of compiling numbers with heavy playing time, until the past two seasons, when injuries began to creep in and a decline in skills led to him sliding down the batting order. He remains a high-contact hitter, but the quality of that contact is on the decline and his numbers have been in a three-year decline with his aging curve accelerating. He is currently projected to hit leadoff for the Padres, which is mostly based off his experience rather than recent production. That, and there is no other obvious candidate. He'll need better BABIP fortune to return to the form he last showed in 2016.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":277.0,"1":67.0,"2":0.241877256,"3":13.0,"4":1.0,"5":9.0,"6":23.0,"7":44.0,"8":109.0,"9":0.393501805,"10":24.0,"11":0.0,"12":2.0,"13":2.0,"14":2.0,"15":0.0,"16":305.0,"17":0.304918033,"18":0.698419838,"19":0.0,"20":42.0,"21":29.0,"22":0.0,"23":8.0,"24":3.0,"25":5.0,"26":6.0,"27":44.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":71.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":17,"statCategoryRanking":120,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.55238783},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":0.5379676},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":1.070362},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.5312605},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":1.8355463}],"totalRanking":226,"totalRating":3.4227486}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":34967,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":7,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":343,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[8,5,12,16,17],"firstName":"Kyle","fullName":"Kyle Tucker","id":34967,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"3","lastName":"Tucker","lastNewsDate":1545224301000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":261.2824074074074,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":8.720930232558139,"percentStarted":5.426356589147287},"proTeamId":18,"stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":223.0,"1":53.0,"2":0.237668161,"3":11.0,"4":1.0,"5":8.0,"6":20.0,"7":33.0,"8":90.0,"9":0.403587444,"10":17.0,"11":1.0,"12":2.0,"13":3.0,"14":3.0,"15":0.0,"16":245.0,"17":0.293877551,"18":0.697464995,"19":0.0,"20":29.0,"21":30.0,"22":0.0,"23":6.0,"24":3.0,"25":3.0,"26":5.0,"27":59.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":57.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":81,"statCategoryRanking":602,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.8559239},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.9263052},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.8096115},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.9735049},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.44554687}],"totalRanking":1336,"totalRating":-4.0108924}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":31358,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":6,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":345,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[2,4,6,19,9,5,12,16,17],"firstName":"Enrique","fullName":"Enrique Hernandez","id":31358,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"14","lastName":"Hernandez","lastNewsDate":1547220153000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":256.3573085846868,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":12.815533980582524,"percentStarted":9.12621359223301},"proTeamId":19,"seasonOutlook":"Hernandez's platoon production over the past two seasons serves as a great reminder that it takes almost 10 full seasons before a right-handed batter \"owns\" his splits. In 2017, Hernandez posted an OPS that came in at a whopping 447 points higher versus southpaws. Last season, however, he registered a mark 53 points better against right-handers. The root of the improvement was power, as Hernandez hit more fly balls versus righties, as well as sporting a 16.2 percent HR/FB rate without the platoon edge -- as opposed to 12.9 percent with the edge. The added power earned Hernandez more playing time, though that's not a lock to remain the case in 2018 given the Dodgers' deep roster. There's a good chance Hernandez sees some regression in the power department. However, with second base, shortstop and outfield eligibility, plus the chance of adding both corner infield spots to his repertoire, Hernandez is an option in deeper leagues.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":352.0,"1":84.0,"2":0.238636364,"3":17.0,"4":2.0,"5":16.0,"6":35.0,"7":49.0,"8":153.0,"9":0.434659091,"10":46.0,"11":4.0,"12":1.0,"13":4.0,"14":8.0,"15":4.0,"16":407.0,"17":0.321867322,"18":0.756526413,"19":0.0,"20":57.0,"21":44.0,"22":0.0,"23":3.0,"24":0.0,"25":3.0,"26":5.0,"27":78.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":147.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":22,"statCategoryRanking":130,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":0.17968412},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":1.270104},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":1.103933},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.6680574},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.1414011}],"totalRanking":241,"totalRating":3.0803773}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":30878,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":4,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":347,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[2,3,4,6,7,19,10,5,12,16,17],"firstName":"Hernan","fullName":"Hernan Perez","id":30878,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"14","lastName":"Perez","lastNewsDate":1548925411000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":259.65429234338745,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":8.737864077669903,"percentStarted":7.766990291262136},"proTeamId":8,"seasonOutlook":"Perez's OPS declined for the second straight season in 2018, but he remained a valuable player for the Brewers, seeing extended action at the three infield spots left of first base and also in the corner outfield spots. He did not do much facing right-handed pitchers, but he posted an OPS north of .780 against southpaws for the third season in a row. Perez's struggles against righties mean he will remain a part-time player at best for the Brewers, but depending how the rest of the offseason goes, he should at least play regularly against lefties early on. Perez required offseason surgery on his hand, but he has already recovered from the procedure and should be good to go to begin the season. Fantasy players will need to pick their spots with Perez, but he does bring a little bit of speed and a little bit of pop to the table, falling just a homer short in 2018 of posting his third straight season with double digits in both home runs and stolen bases.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":317.0,"1":82.0,"2":0.258675079,"3":13.0,"4":2.0,"5":9.0,"6":24.0,"7":58.0,"8":126.0,"9":0.397476341,"10":16.0,"11":1.0,"12":2.0,"13":2.0,"14":4.0,"15":2.0,"16":338.0,"17":0.295857988,"18":0.693334329,"19":0.0,"20":35.0,"21":34.0,"22":0.0,"23":14.0,"24":4.0,"25":10.0,"26":8.0,"27":67.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":113.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":26,"statCategoryRanking":216,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":0.044794843},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":0.01501305},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":0.06323333},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.11852455},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":1.075182}],"totalRanking":418,"totalRating":1.0796986}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":33390,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":6,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":348,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[3,4,6,7,19,12,16,17],"firstName":"Aledmys","fullName":"Aledmys Diaz","id":33390,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"16","lastName":"Diaz","lastNewsDate":1550243049000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":261.29398148148147,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":5.813953488372093,"percentStarted":3.488372093023256},"proTeamId":18,"seasonOutlook":"Aided by a significant park boost going from St. Louis to Toronto last offseason, the utility infielder slugged a personal-high 18 homers, albeit with the lowest average of his three-year career. Average exit velocity, hard-hit rate and barrels were all a career-high for Diaz, suggesting the batting average may have resulted from bad luck. He maintained an excellent contact rate so look for Diaz to rebound in 2019 after Toronto shipped him to Houston in November. The problem is Diaz likely won't play nearly as much with the Astros, assuming Jose Altuve and Carlos Correa are healthy. Defensively, Diaz can play all around the infield, but unlike Marwin Gonzalez, he doesn't also play the outfield. It's possible Diaz could work into the DH picture and Houston will likely play Diaz enough for those in AL-only formats. However, he's no longer a mixed-league option.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":212.0,"1":54.0,"2":0.254716981,"3":12.0,"4":0.0,"5":8.0,"6":20.0,"7":34.0,"8":90.0,"9":0.424528302,"10":12.0,"11":1.0,"12":1.0,"13":2.0,"14":2.0,"15":0.0,"16":227.0,"17":0.295154185,"18":0.719682487,"19":0.0,"20":27.0,"21":26.0,"22":0.0,"23":2.0,"24":2.0,"25":0.0,"26":4.0,"27":32.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":61.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":25,"statCategoryRanking":143,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":0.4768662},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":0.95633125},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":0.7010815},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.77065504},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.1414011}],"totalRanking":264,"totalRating":2.7635329}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":30456,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":2,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":349,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[0,12,16,17],"firstName":"Jonathan","fullName":"Jonathan Lucroy","id":30456,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"21","lastName":"Lucroy","lastNewsDate":1546019119000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":259.26851851851853,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":11.434108527131784,"percentStarted":7.364341085271318},"proTeamId":3,"seasonOutlook":"Lucroy spent 2018 playing for his fourth team in three seasons, but he ended up topping 450 plate appearances during his only campaign in Oakland. The output was dismal, however, as he compiled a .241/.291/.325 line and hit just four homers, working mostly as the A's No. 9 hitter. His defense continues to drive his opportunities to start regularly, which lays the foundation for a bounce-back campaign at near-zero cost if he's able to make major adjustments at the plate. All signs now point to his 24-homer effort in 2016 with the Brewers and Rangers to be a peak-season outlier, as he's hit just 17 homers between 2015, 2017 and 2018 combined. Look for Lucroy to have a regular place at the bottom of the Angels' lineup four or five times each week after he signed a one-year deal with them in December.

as lucky as Williams was in 2017 with a .375 BABIP, he was as snakebitten last season with a .312 mark. Williams' line-drive rate increased a tick while his hard-hit rate dropped three points. The main difference in BABIP was nine more infield hits in 2017. Prorate that to last season's at-bats and Williams' BABIP would have been .348, more in line with his track record. The misfortune masked improved plate skills, as Williams walked more and whiffed fewer times than his rookie campaign. Considering his poor defense and potentially crowded Phillies outfield, Williams needs to continue to develop his on-base skills and hit more fly balls (career 29.9 percent) to better take advantage of a career 18.8 percent HR/FB mark. Until those manifest, Williams is best suited for very-deep mixed and NL-only formats.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":455.0,"1":114.0,"2":0.250549451,"3":18.0,"4":4.0,"5":19.0,"6":41.0,"7":73.0,"8":197.0,"9":0.432967033,"10":29.0,"11":1.0,"12":8.0,"13":2.0,"14":2.0,"15":0.0,"16":494.0,"17":0.305668016,"18":0.738635049,"19":0.0,"20":61.0,"21":61.0,"22":0.0,"23":4.0,"24":3.0,"25":1.0,"26":7.0,"27":141.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":135.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":24,"statCategoryRanking":165,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":0.15297069},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":0.85174036},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":0.63393956},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.59965897},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.1414011}],"totalRanking":309,"totalRating":2.0969086}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":32355,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":6,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":355,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[4,6,19,12,16,17],"firstName":"Nick","fullName":"Nick Ahmed","id":32355,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"13","lastName":"Ahmed","lastNewsDate":1547230251000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":261.7169373549884,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":5.242718446601942,"percentStarted":3.883495145631068},"proTeamId":29,"stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":496.0,"1":117.0,"2":0.235887097,"3":28.0,"4":4.0,"5":14.0,"6":46.0,"7":71.0,"8":195.0,"9":0.393145161,"10":36.0,"11":2.0,"12":3.0,"13":4.0,"14":6.0,"15":2.0,"16":541.0,"17":0.288354898,"18":0.68150006,"19":0.0,"20":57.0,"21":61.0,"22":0.0,"23":6.0,"24":5.0,"25":1.0,"26":14.0,"27":106.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":153.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":30,"statCategoryRanking":159,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.8649244},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":0.74714947},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":0.90250725},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":1.2836432},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":0.16274466}],"totalRanking":301,"totalRating":2.2311203}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":28658,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":9,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":356,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[10,5,12,16,17],"firstName":"Carlos","fullName":"Carlos Gonzalez","id":28658,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"5","lastName":"Gonzalez","lastNewsDate":1538487012000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":259.800464037123,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":8.349514563106796,"percentStarted":4.854368932038835},"proTeamId":27,"seasonOutlook":"For the second straight season, Gonzalez failed to top 20 homers despite playing half of his games in Coors Field.

Now 33, Gonzalez is unlikely to return to the Rockies as a free agent, and his baseline in a neutral environment is likely that of a .250-.260 hitter with 15-homer pop. His best path to regular playing time would come from a non-contending club, but even if that offer materializes, the ceiling is much lower now than it was at his peak. Moreover, he could be at the point of his career where he's viewed as a bench player by the teams most interested in his services, which would push him off the radar in most mixed leagues.

Driving the skid was a .258 BABIP versus righty pitching, well below the .334 mark posted in that scenario the previous two seasons. Considering Reddick's BABIP against the shift was better than no shift, he likely ran into a lot of bad luck.

The volume of playing time helped Sanchez compile above-replacement level counting stats in most mixed leagues, which is integral because, on a per-plate-appearance basis, his runs-plus-RBI were fifth-lowest in the league. Sanchez held his own defensively at third base, but it's understandable why the White Sox are looking for an offensive upgrade at the position. Even if Sanchez continues to man the position on a regular basis, there are more productive options at the corner infield spot.

The OBP chops allow him to hit high in the lineup when needed, but he is best served hitting lower in the lineup, given the lack of extra-base power at this advanced stage of his career. He maintains high walk and low strikeout rates but is also mostly a one-category player these days with barely average run production. At age 38 and in the final year of his deal, this could be it for the versatile Zobrist, who shed his light-hitting reserve infielder expectations in 2008 and has not looked back.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":460.0,"1":125.0,"2":0.27173913,"3":26.0,"4":3.0,"5":11.0,"6":40.0,"7":85.0,"8":190.0,"9":0.413043478,"10":61.0,"11":1.0,"12":2.0,"13":5.0,"14":6.0,"15":1.0,"16":529.0,"17":0.355387524,"18":0.768431002,"19":0.0,"20":66.0,"21":55.0,"22":0.0,"23":3.0,"24":4.0,"25":-1.0,"26":8.0,"27":68.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":136.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":13,"statCategoryRanking":97,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":2.4260192},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":0.01501305},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":1.103933},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.87325263},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.1414011}],"totalRanking":161,"totalRating":4.2768164}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":32695,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":3,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":361,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[1,7,19,12,16,17],"firstName":"Greg","fullName":"Greg Bird","id":32695,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"33","lastName":"Bird","lastNewsDate":1547133054000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":259.96064814814815,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":8.527131782945736,"percentStarted":5.813953488372093},"proTeamId":10,"stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":166.0,"1":32.0,"2":0.192771084,"3":9.0,"4":0.0,"5":8.0,"6":17.0,"7":15.0,"8":65.0,"9":0.391566265,"10":21.0,"11":0.0,"12":3.0,"13":2.0,"14":2.0,"15":0.0,"16":192.0,"17":0.291666667,"18":0.683232932,"19":0.0,"20":18.0,"21":23.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":3.0,"27":47.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":51.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":44,"statCategoryRanking":357,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":-1.5678575},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":0.22419488},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.3731891},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.18926838},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.5976197}],"totalRanking":925,"totalRating":-2.1252031}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":32161,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":3,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":362,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[1,7,19,12,16,17,11],"firstName":"Tyler","fullName":"Tyler Austin","id":32161,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"31","lastName":"Austin","lastNewsDate":1538299376000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":261.3611111111111,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":4.263565891472868,"percentStarted":2.9069767441860463},"proTeamId":9,"seasonOutlook":"After playing sporadically over the first four months of the season, Austin was dealt to the Twins right before the July 31 trade deadline. He was initially assigned to Triple-A Rochester before being called up on Aug. 10. Austin played fairly regularly down the stretch, recording a .782 OPS with nine homers in 136 plate appearances. Power is his game, buoyed by a career 27.6 percent HR/FB mark along with a 38.8 percent fly ball rate. However, a career 36.6 percent strikeout clip limits his ability to get to his power, though Austin did fan only 30.9 percent of the time with Minnesota. Regardless, playing time will be an issue, as C.J. Cron is slated to play first with Nelson Cruz earmarked for designated hitter.

It should be noted, however, that he was shelved with a hamstring strain and an oblique strain on separate occasions last season. Although he's drawn walks at an elevated clip in each of the past two campaigns, Frazier has become a heavy pull hitter, which has lowered his batting average floor. He still makes occasional hard contact, ranking 96th among 332 qualified hitters in average exit velocity last season. Offseason additions to the Mets' infield have made the playing-time outlook cloudy for Frazier, who will likely fall into a backup role at the corner-infield spots once Peter Alonso is summoned from Triple-A to take over as the starting first baseman in early 2019.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":427.0,"1":90.0,"2":0.210772834,"3":17.0,"4":0.0,"5":22.0,"6":39.0,"7":51.0,"8":173.0,"9":0.405152225,"10":56.0,"11":1.0,"12":7.0,"13":6.0,"14":6.0,"15":0.0,"16":496.0,"17":0.308467742,"18":0.713619967,"19":0.0,"20":63.0,"21":68.0,"22":0.0,"23":8.0,"24":4.0,"25":4.0,"26":9.0,"27":118.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":122.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":25,"statCategoryRanking":187,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":-1.5976462},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":0.95633125},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":0.6675105},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.90745187},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":0.77103615}],"totalRanking":356,"totalRating":1.7046835}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":32255,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":2,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":365,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[0,1,7,19,12,16,17],"firstName":"John","fullName":"John Hicks","id":32255,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"55","lastName":"Hicks","lastNewsDate":1544613145000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":261.474537037037,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":3.875968992248062,"percentStarted":2.5193798449612403},"proTeamId":6,"stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":383.0,"1":98.0,"2":0.255874674,"3":18.0,"4":1.0,"5":12.0,"6":31.0,"7":67.0,"8":154.0,"9":0.402088773,"10":24.0,"11":0.0,"12":4.0,"13":4.0,"14":5.0,"15":1.0,"16":416.0,"17":0.302884615,"18":0.704973388,"19":0.0,"20":46.0,"21":47.0,"22":0.0,"23":2.0,"24":3.0,"25":-1.0,"26":15.0,"27":107.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":110.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":20,"statCategoryRanking":270,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":0.2655284},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":0.01501305},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":0.029662376},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.015926907},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.5976197}],"totalRanking":561,"totalRating":-0.30334282}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":32061,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":4,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":367,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[2,6,19,12,16,17],"firstName":"Kolten","fullName":"Kolten Wong","id":32061,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"16","lastName":"Wong","lastNewsDate":1538311253000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":260.9443155452436,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":6.213592233009709,"percentStarted":4.854368932038835},"proTeamId":24,"seasonOutlook":"Wong struggled out of the gate in 2018, hitting just .213/.304/.361 through 87 games before the All-Star break, but the second baseman turned things around in the second half to the tune of .317/.384/.439.

During his time on the field, Robertson was 27 percent better than the average big-league hitter. He upped his fly ball rate from 45.9 percent to 50.7 percent while pulling the ball far more than he did as a rookie. The result was a big uptick in rate power. For a lot of players who attempt to increase their launch angle, the adjustment comes with an increase in strikeouts, but that wasn't the case with Robertson; in fact he shaved six percentage points off his K-rate (to 22.6 percent). He qualifies at both middle infield positions and can help pretty much everywhere.
