These are traits the Cardinals generally put to good use. After making the club out of spring training as a utility infielder, Munoz played regularly when Paul DeJong missed two months with a broken hand. He also filled in for Kolten Wong at second. Surprisingly, he displayed more power than speed, hitting eight homers while swiping only five bases in 11 attempts. His defense also came up short, as he checked in with a minus-6 defensive runs saved at both middle infield positions. Munoz's rookie-year .763 OPS and likely improved glove will keep him on the roster as a utility player and injury fill-in, more useful for the Redbirds than in fantasy.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":218.0,"1":54.0,"2":0.247706422,"3":10.0,"4":1.0,"5":5.0,"6":16.0,"7":38.0,"8":81.0,"9":0.371559633,"10":15.0,"11":2.0,"12":2.0,"13":2.0,"14":2.0,"15":0.0,"16":237.0,"17":0.299578059,"18":0.671137692,"19":0.0,"20":25.0,"21":27.0,"22":0.0,"23":4.0,"24":4.0,"25":0.0,"26":3.0,"27":49.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":64.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":37,"statCategoryRanking":200,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":0.7724693},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.08957786},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":0.1639462},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.32606524},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":0.16274466}],"totalRanking":382,"totalRating":1.3356475}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":35238,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":7,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":386,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[8,5,12,16,17],"firstName":"Willie","fullName":"Willie Calhoun","id":35238,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"5","lastName":"Calhoun","lastNewsDate":1545047228000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":262.11574074074076,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":7.364341085271318,"percentStarted":4.844961240310077},"proTeamId":13,"stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":427.0,"1":108.0,"2":0.2529274,"3":23.0,"4":1.0,"5":14.0,"6":38.0,"7":70.0,"8":175.0,"9":0.409836066,"10":28.0,"11":3.0,"12":5.0,"13":3.0,"14":4.0,"15":1.0,"16":464.0,"17":0.30387931,"18":0.713715376,"19":0.0,"20":51.0,"21":50.0,"22":0.0,"23":2.0,"24":1.0,"25":1.0,"26":9.0,"27":64.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":114.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":63,"statCategoryRanking":451,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.34595457},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.7171233},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.87675345},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.7341104},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.5976197}],"totalRanking":1157,"totalRating":-3.2715616}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":29670,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":6,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":387,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[4,6,19,12,16,17],"firstName":"Freddy","fullName":"Freddy Galvis","id":29670,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"13","lastName":"Galvis","lastNewsDate":1548754511000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":262.1809744779582,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":3.6893203883495147,"percentStarted":3.3009708737864076},"proTeamId":14,"seasonOutlook":"Galvis is best known for his durability, as the 29-year-old is the only player in the majors to have played every game each of the past two seasons. The shortstop is also known for his defense -- he received a third consecutive Gold Glove nomination in 2018 -- which has helped keep Galvis in the lineup on a consistent basis despite his below-average bat (career 77 wRC+). Galvis finished the 2018 season with a .248/.299/.380 slash line across 656 plate appearances. His power held steady, swatting 13 homers (after hitting 12 in 2017), but his success rate on the bases declined, with Galvis caught on six of his 14 attempts. Volume alone has made Galvis an asset in deep formats. The playing time should be there again in 2019 after he signed with the Blue Jays, but the stolen bases could disappear given his declining success and the fact that Toronto stole just 47 bases as a

is best known for his flashy glove and lightning-quick hands, often appearing to get throws away before the bouncing ball even meets leather. He's been able to translate his hand-eye coordination and quickness to the batter's box, where his primary asset is an exceptional 12 percent career strikeout rate, yielding a fantasy-useful batting-average floor. However, with just 21 career homers in 2,385 plate appearances, Iglesias is a drain in homers, as well as in runs and RBI. Iglesias did chip in 15 steals last season -- a career-best, but the Tigers decided not to bring him back for 2019. If he signs with a running team, Iglesias could again secure double-digit swipes. Still, considering his lack of power and an average of just 128 games played over the past four seasons, Iglesias has little fantasy viability outside the deepest of formats.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":443.0,"1":113.0,"2":0.255079007,"3":28.0,"4":1.0,"5":5.0,"6":34.0,"7":79.0,"8":158.0,"9":0.356659142,"10":21.0,"11":0.0,"12":5.0,"13":1.0,"14":3.0,"15":2.0,"16":472.0,"17":0.294491525,"18":0.651150668,"19":0.0,"20":48.0,"21":46.0,"22":0.0,"23":11.0,"24":6.0,"25":5.0,"26":8.0,"27":54.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":126.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":24,"statCategoryRanking":139,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":0.72383076},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.4033506},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":0.29823002},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.5312605},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":1.6834735}],"totalRanking":256,"totalRating":2.833444}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":34693,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":8,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":399,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[9,5,12,16,17],"firstName":"Dustin","fullName":"Dustin Fowler","id":34693,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"11","lastName":"Fowler","lastNewsDate":1535727163000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":261.8611111111111,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":4.844961240310077,"percentStarted":4.069767441860465},"proTeamId":11,"stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":397.0,"1":102.0,"2":0.256926952,"3":19.0,"4":9.0,"5":10.0,"6":38.0,"7":64.0,"8":169.0,"9":0.425692695,"10":15.0,"11":0.0,"12":2.0,"13":2.0,"14":2.0,"15":0.0,"16":416.0,"17":0.286057692,"18":0.711750388,"19":0.0,"20":47.0,"21":48.0,"22":0.0,"23":14.0,"24":8.0,"25":6.0,"26":5.0,"27":87.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":104.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":37,"statCategoryRanking":316,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.6020023},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.2987597},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.50747293},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.32371983},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":0.31481755}],"totalRanking":738,"totalRating":-1.4171373}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":29551,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":9,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":400,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[9,10,5,12,16,17],"firstName":"Jason","fullName":"Jason Heyward","id":29551,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"22","lastName":"Heyward","lastNewsDate":1538486484000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":259.22969837587004,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":8.349514563106796,"percentStarted":6.796116504854369},"proTeamId":16,"seasonOutlook":"Let's start with the positives: Heyward improved his slash line across the board for a second straight season, while his strikeout rate dropped to a career-low 12.3 percent. Even with his improvements at the dish, the 29-year-old was worse than a league-average hitter (99 wRC+) for the third consecutive season. Heyward failed to hit double-digit homers for just the second time in his career, while his lone stolen base marked a career low. On top of it all, injuries limited him to fewer than 500 plate appearances for a second straight season. With five years and $105 million left on his contract, Heyward should continue to see significant playing time for the Cubs, but consistent reps in a good lineup can only take a player so far.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":418.0,"1":108.0,"2":0.258373206,"3":20.0,"4":3.0,"5":8.0,"6":31.0,"7":77.0,"8":158.0,"9":0.377990431,"10":41.0,"11":1.0,"12":2.0,"13":2.0,"14":4.0,"15":2.0,"16":465.0,"17":0.324731183,"18":0.702721613,"19":0.0,"20":57.0,"21":50.0,"22":0.0,"23":3.0,"24":2.0,"25":1.0,"26":7.0,"27":63.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":119.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":22,"statCategoryRanking":160,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":0.8197923},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.08957786},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":1.103933},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.83905345},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.44554687}],"totalRanking":302,"totalRating":2.227654}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":30268,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":2,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":401,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[0,12,16,17],"firstName":"Manny","fullName":"Manny Pina","id":30268,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"9","lastName":"Pina","lastNewsDate":1547203704000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":262.3201856148492,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":3.495145631067961,"percentStarted":2.912621359223301},"proTeamId":8,"stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":139.0,"1":36.0,"2":0.258992806,"3":7.0,"4":1.0,"5":4.0,"6":12.0,"7":24.0,"8":57.0,"9":0.410071942,"10":9.0,"11":1.0,"12":3.0,"13":1.0,"14":1.0,"15":0.0,"16":152.0,"17":0.315789474,"18":0.725861416,"19":0.0,"20":17.0,"21":15.0,"22":0.0,"23":1.0,"24":0.0,"25":1.0,"26":4.0,"27":29.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":44.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":18,"statCategoryRanking":266,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.0062489887},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":0.01501305},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":0.1639462},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.15272376},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.293474}],"totalRanking":553,"totalRating":-0.27348748}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":31402,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":5,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":403,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[3,7,19,12,16,17],"firstName":"Jedd","fullName":"Jedd Gyorko","id":31402,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"3","lastName":"Gyorko","lastNewsDate":1538302074000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":261.8375870069606,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":4.660194174757281,"percentStarted":4.077669902912621},"proTeamId":24,"seasonOutlook":"For the third straight season, Gyorko was at least 10 percent better than the average big-league hitter. He missed time due to both hamstring and groin injuries, but wound up slashing .262/.346/.416 across 125 games (402 plate appearances) with the Cardinals. While the 30-year-old improved both his strikeout and walk rates, resulting in a career-best 0.57 BB/K, he also experienced a noticeable downtick in his power production, falling short of 15 homers for just the second time in his career. Gyorko's batted-ball profile suggests his power could rebound in 2019, given ample playing time. The problem is that the playing time may not be there. He appears primed for a reduced role following St. Louis' offseason acquisition of Paul Goldschmidt. Gyorko is now projected to open the season on the short side of a second-base

much went right for Wieters in 2018. Looking to rebound after a disappointing first season in Washington, the backstop almost immediately landed on the disabled list with an oblique strain. He returned briefly before a hamstring injury sent him back to the shelf for more than two months. Add in wrist and groin issues, and Wieters wound up appearing in just 76 games for the Nationals in 2018. When healthy, the 32-year-old hit .238/.330/.374 with eight homers and 30 RBI. He's set to hit the open market after a disappointing two-year stint with Washington that saw him hit .230 with a .658 OPS in 199 games. Even if a team gives Wieters a chance to start in 2019, durability concerns along with a fading skill set make him a tough

off a season in which McCann displayed improved plate skills with burgeoning power, he fell short of increased expectations. As such, the Tigers opted to non-tender the 28-year-old backstop, paving the way for McCann to sign with the White Sox, likely to back up Welington Castillo. However, with Castillo on the second year of two-year deal plus a team option, he could be traded, leaving McCann to keep the position warm until Zack Collins is ready to take over. McCann's defense is above average, which could help the maturing White Sox rotation. McCann's power should rebound, aided by the more homer-friendly Guaranteed Rate Park. That said, his new digs should further dent his already weak on-base skills. Still, he should play enough to draw interest in deep, two-catcher leagues.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":172.0,"1":38.0,"2":0.220930233,"3":6.0,"4":0.0,"5":4.0,"6":10.0,"7":28.0,"8":56.0,"9":0.325581395,"10":11.0,"11":0.0,"12":2.0,"13":1.0,"14":1.0,"15":0.0,"16":186.0,"17":0.274193548,"18":0.599774944,"19":0.0,"20":14.0,"21":18.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":1.0,"25":-1.0,"26":4.0,"27":50.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":49.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":38,"statCategoryRanking":344,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":-1.3611093},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.08957786},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.10462145},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.22346759},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.5976197}],"totalRanking":860,"totalRating":-1.9294608}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":32779,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":8,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":435,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[9,5,12,16,17],"firstName":"Roman","fullName":"Roman

a promising prospect for the Pirates, Hanson's game never fully materialized. Spotty defense, maturity issues, and an impatient approach at the plate -- along with stagnated power -- curtailed Hanson's development. Even his speed failed to manifest, in large part due to poor on-base skills. Still, due to Hanson's ability to play multiple spots around the diamond, he can be an asset for both the Giants and fantasy managers alike. His versatility has allowed him to average 108 games played over the past two seasons and, health permitting, Hanson should challenge that number again. A career 22.2 percent K-rate and a 4.0 percent BB-rate expose Hanson when he plays regularly, but his smattering of speed and power plays well in NL-only leagues. Hanson begins the season with eligibility at both second base and in the outfield, but chances are he will add both third base and shortstop to the mix as the season progresses.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":491.0,"1":122.0,"2":0.248472505,"3":24.0,"4":8.0,"5":10.0,"6":42.0,"7":80.0,"8":192.0,"9":0.391038697,"10":24.0,"11":0.0,"12":4.0,"13":4.0,"14":8.0,"15":4.0,"16":526.0,"17":0.285171103,"18":0.676209799,"19":0.0,"20":66.0,"21":47.0,"22":0.0,"23":21.0,"24":10.0,"25":11.0,"26":8.0,"27":106.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":141.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":29,"statCategoryRanking":230,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.003939677},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.08957786},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":0.06323333},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.22346759},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":0.46689042}],"totalRanking":460,"totalRating":0.6600738}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":31360,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":8,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":450,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[9,5,12,16,17],"firstName":"Delino","fullName":"Delino DeShields","id":31360,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"3","lastName":"DeShields","lastNewsDate":1547215985000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":261.9513888888889,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":4.844961240310077,"percentStarted":3.682170542635659},"proTeamId":13,"stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":278.0,"1":64.0,"2":0.230215827,"3":11.0,"4":1.0,"5":3.0,"6":15.0,"7":49.0,"8":86.0,"9":0.309352518,"10":36.0,"11":0.0,"12":2.0,"13":1.0,"14":9.0,"15":8.0,"16":325.0,"17":0.313846154,"18":0.623198672,"19":0.0,"20":42.0,"21":16.0,"22":0.0,"23":18.0,"24":6.0,"25":12.0,"26":1.0,"27":74.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":89.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":27,"statCategoryRanking":228,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":-1.271542},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.7171233},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":0.6003686},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.35791904},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":2.443838}],"totalRanking":455,"totalRating":0.697622}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":30934,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":4,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":453,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[2,6,19,12,16,17],"firstName":"Josh","fullName":"Josh Harrison","id":30934,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"5","lastName":"Harrison","lastNewsDate":1540989748000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":260.9860788863109,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":5.048543689320389,"percentStarted":3.3009708737864076},"proTeamId":23,"seasonOutlook":"In the four seasons prior to 2018, Harrison built up a reputation as a reliable late-round middle infielder, batting .290 while averaging 9.3 homers and 14.8 steals per season. Injuries hit him hard last year, limiting him to 97 games, in which he hit just .250 with eight homers and three steals. If injuries were the sole issue, an offseason to recover could return him to his previous form and make him a deep-league value. He's now 31 years old, however, and the speed which helped him steal bases and propped up his average has started to leave him. It will take more than a small rebound from the veteran for him to be worthwhile in 12-team mixed leagues.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":323.0,"1":84.0,"2":0.26006192,"3":14.0,"4":2.0,"5":8.0,"6":24.0,"7":60.0,"8":126.0,"9":0.390092879,"10":15.0,"11":1.0,"12":7.0,"13":3.0,"14":4.0,"15":1.0,"16":349.0,"17":0.303724928,"18":0.693817808,"19":0.0,"20":41.0,"21":36.0,"22":0.0,"23":6.0,"24":2.0,"25":4.0,"26":5.0,"27":61.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":87.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":34,"statCategoryRanking":250,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.065643415},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.08957786},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":0.2310881},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.15506916},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.1414011}],"totalRanking":517,"totalRating":0.08953489}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":32087,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":4,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":455,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[2,6,19,12,16,17],"firstName":"Joe","fullName":"Joe Panik","id":32087,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"12","lastName":"Panik","lastNewsDate":1538295404000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":261.56380510440835,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":6.019417475728155,"percentStarted":3.883495145631068},"proTeamId":26,"seasonOutlook":"The next time someone pulls the \"on pace\" card, remind this person that, during the first week of last season, Panik was \"on pace\" for 97 homers.

Panik missed the end of April and early May with a sprained thumb, which was followed by a three-week DL visit in July with a sore groin. Even when healthy, Panik didn't play as much as usual, regularly sitting against lefties during the second half. Panik's game remains putting the ball in play, as he fanned a career low 7.7 percent of the time.

spending his entire career with the Mets, debuting as a 21-year-old in 2013, Flores signed with Arizona where he seeks increased playing time. There's a strong chance Flores is the everyday second baseman, with Ketel Marte shifting to the outfield. However, Flores was diagnosed with early onset arthritis last September. He was deemed fully healthy by season's end, but it's still somewhat troubling for someone expected to play regularly at a position requiring athleticism and something to do on every batted ball. At the plate, Flores has handled southpaws better than the league average platoon split, while doing the opposite against right-handers. Additional exposure to same-side pitching should help close the gap.

d'Arnaud added another chapter to his book of injuries in 2018. The backstop was diagnosed with a torn UCL in his elbow in April and underwent Tommy John surgery, ending his campaign after all of four games. D'Arnaud reached 300 plate appearances only once in the past four seasons, and he has logged 400 plate appearances only once in his career, back in 2014. Even after another injury-plagued season, the Mets tendered him a contract for 2019, though they brought in Wilson Ramos to take over the starting job. Ramos has dealt with injuries of his own and it's probably too early to close the book completely on d'Arnaud given his power (16 homers in 2017), but at this point the hype is gone and d'Arnaud should merely be a fallback when your other cheap second-catcher targets are off the board.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":145.0,"1":35.0,"2":0.24137931,"3":6.0,"4":0.0,"5":6.0,"6":12.0,"7":23.0,"8":59.0,"9":0.406896552,"10":10.0,"11":1.0,"12":1.0,"13":1.0,"14":1.0,"15":0.0,"16":157.0,"17":0.292993631,"18":0.699890182,"19":0.0,"20":17.0,"21":21.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":4.0,"27":28.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":42.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":78,"statCategoryRanking":503,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.096028514},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.8217143},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":-1.1117501},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":-1.0077041},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.5976197}],"totalRanking":1228,"totalRating":-3.6348166}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":6309,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":2,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":485,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[0,12,16,17],"firstName":"Brian","fullName":"Brian McCann","id":6309,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"16","lastName":"McCann","lastNewsDate":1543230151000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":260.2037037037037,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":6.007751937984496,"percentStarted":4.844961240310077},"proTeamId":15,"seasonOutlook":"Proving that you can go home again, McCann is returning to the organization that drafted him in 2002, as the Braves have decided to pair him behind the plate with Tyler Flowers. Despite his being a left-handed bat, and with Flowers swinging from the right side, expect more of a time-share than McCann enjoying the larger end of a natural platoon. McCann's plate skills slipped a bit last season, but the larger issues are a drop in power and durability concerns. Already a fly-ball hitter, McCann lofted a career-high 50 percent last season, though a declining hard-hit rate resulted in his lowest HR/FB rate since his rookie campaign. After his defense saw some slippage over three seasons, his work behind the plate actually improved a bit in 2018. Even if he were to play against all right-handed pitching, McCann is still best deployed in deeper two-catcher formats ? and even then, he's certainly a risk to your batting average.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":270.0,"1":65.0,"2":0.240740741,"3":8.0,"4":0.0,"5":11.0,"6":19.0,"7":46.0,"8":106.0,"9":0.392592593,"10":30.0,"11":1.0,"12":5.0,"13":2.0,"14":2.0,"15":0.0,"16":307.0,"17":0.325732899,"18":0.718325492,"19":0.0,"20":33.0,"21":38.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":1.0,"25":-1.0,"26":6.0,"27":55.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":83.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":43,"statCategoryRanking":374,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.8558323},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.19416878},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.40676004},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.32371983},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.5976197}],"totalRanking":986,"totalRating":-2.3781006}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":28636,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":7,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":487,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[8,5,12,16,17],"firstName":"Alex","fullName":"Alex Gordon","id":28636,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"4","lastName":"Gordon","lastNewsDate":1538306192000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":262.2546296296296,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":3.488372093023256,"percentStarted":3.294573643410853},"proTeamId":7,"seasonOutlook":"Gordon rebounded from a miserable 2017, but the landing was an 89 wRC+ (100 is average) and just $2 earned in 12-team mixed leagues. He cut his strikeout rate back around his career average (21.7 percent) and chipped in double-digit homers and steals, but was hurt by the poor lineup around him, totaling a mere 110 runs-plus-RBI in 568 plate appearances. Gordon continued to shine on defense, winning his sixth Gold Glove at age 34. That defense should keep him on the field every day to begin 2019, though with Gordon entering the final guaranteed year of his contract, he's at risk of being traded to a contender and losing out on playing time later in the season.

His defense between second base, third, shortstop and right field was so good that he ended up being worth two wins above replacement in 80 games despite grading out as 11 percent worse than league average offensively. He put bat to ball with great consistency, striking out at a low 11.1 percent clip, but his walk rate was well below average at 4.9 percent, and far worse for fantasy players, he flashed very little power. Fletcher never hit more than six homers on the farm and his .088 ISO against major-league pitching is quiet poor. The soon-to-be 25-year-old does have some speed and the defense could earn him the starting job at the keystone, but this is a compiler profile, not one of a potential mixed-league difference maker.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":452.0,"1":116.0,"2":0.256637168,"3":27.0,"4":2.0,"5":3.0,"6":32.0,"7":84.0,"8":156.0,"9":0.345132743,"10":22.0,"11":0.0,"12":5.0,"13":3.0,"14":7.0,"15":4.0,"16":484.0,"17":0.295454545,"18":0.640587289,"19":0.0,"20":55.0,"21":37.0,"22":0.0,"23":9.0,"24":3.0,"25":6.0,"26":12.0,"27":57.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":113.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":36,"statCategoryRanking":277,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":0.6969365},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.8217143},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":0.029662376},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.2553214},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.1414011}],"totalRanking":585,"totalRating":-0.4918379}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":34982,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":5,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":491,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[3,7,19,12,16,17],"firstName":"Austin","fullName":"Austin Riley","id":34982,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"74","lastName":"Riley","lastNewsDate":1543309605000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":262.74941995359626,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":6.407766990291262,"percentStarted":3.6893203883495147},"proTeamId":15,"stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":47.0,"1":11.0,"2":0.234042553,"3":2.0,"4":0.0,"5":2.0,"6":4.0,"7":7.0,"8":19.0,"9":0.404255319,"10":4.0,"11":0.0,"12":1.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":52.0,"17":0.307692308,"18":0.711947627,"19":0.0,"20":6.0,"21":6.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":1.0,"27":17.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":12.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":0,"statCategoryRanking":0,"statRankings":[],"totalRanking":0,"totalRating":0.0}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":32751,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":9,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":495,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[8,9,10,5,12,16,17],"firstName":"Travis","fullName":"Travis Jankowski","id":32751,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"16","lastName":"Jankowski","lastNewsDate":1547133607000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":263.01624129930394,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":3.3009708737864076,"percentStarted":2.912621359223301},"proTeamId":25,"seasonOutlook":"Out of nowhere, Jankowski stole 30 bases in 2016, 16 after the break. His follow-up campaign was lost due to an early-April bone bruise. Despite hitting a surprising three homers last spring, Jankowski began the 2018 season with Triple-A El Paso. He was summoned in late April and stayed up all season. He went on to record a similar season to 2016, swiping 26 bags, but with a different pathway. In 2016, he fanned at a 26.1 percent clip but sported a hefty .343 BABIP. Last season, he whiffed only 18.9 percent of the time, but his BABIP dipped to .319. The Padres' outfield is crowded so Jankowski isn't likely to start. However, since he's one of the few lefty swingers and more importantly can play plus defense at all three spots, Jankowski should play two or three times a week. Not enough for mixed leagues, but plenty for

displaying a fantasy-friendly power/speed combo in the minors, with more of the latter, there was plenty reason to be intrigued about what Ervin could do with regular playing time at the top level. After playing mostly against southpaws over the first half, injuries and a trade paved the way for Ervin to see more playing time after the break. The jury is still out as Ervin responded by slashing .311/.369/.509 from July 20 through August 31, followed by a September swoon with a .192/.263/.342 line. With a strong spring, Ervin has a chance to earn a small side of a platoon job with Scott Schebler in center, though he's more apt to be a reserve, occasionally spelling Schebler and Jesse Winker when a southpaw is on the hill.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":257.0,"1":60.0,"2":0.233463035,"3":13.0,"4":2.0,"5":7.0,"6":22.0,"7":38.0,"8":98.0,"9":0.381322957,"10":26.0,"11":1.0,"12":4.0,"13":3.0,"14":5.0,"15":2.0,"16":290.0,"17":0.310344828,"18":0.691667785,"19":0.0,"20":32.0,"21":34.0,"22":0.0,"23":11.0,"24":6.0,"25":5.0,"26":6.0,"27":70.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":78.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":32,"statCategoryRanking":261,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":0.011323221},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.19416878},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.23890527},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.05012612},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":0.31481755}],"totalRanking":538,"totalRating":-0.15705945}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":6393,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":4,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":510,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[2,6,19,12,16,17],"firstName":"Dustin","fullName":"Dustin Pedroia","id":6393,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"15","lastName":"Pedroia","lastNewsDate":1550241096000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":259.00694444444446,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":6.589147286821706,"percentStarted":4.651162790697675},"proTeamId":2,"seasonOutlook":"Pedroia's 2018 debut was delayed until late May after he underwent offseason surgery on his left knee for the second consecutive October. Unfortunately, after playing just three games, he was sidelined again with continued soreness in the troublesome knee. Little did Pedroia know those would be the only three games he would play, and he needed yet another offseason procedure -- this time removing scar tissue from his left knee. There's a good chance Pedroia won't be ready to break camp with the Red Sox again, which prompted the club to bring back Eduardo Nunez to cover the keystone alongside Brock Holt. Pedroia will be 35 years old, so don't expect much in terms of power and speed. His forte has always been contact and, after so much time off, there's a chance his timing will be slow to return. Until he proves otherwise, Pedroia is nothing more than someone to monitor in most formats.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":216.0,"1":63.0,"2":0.291666667,"3":11.0,"4":0.0,"5":4.0,"6":15.0,"7":48.0,"8":86.0,"9":0.398148148,"10":23.0,"11":1.0,"12":1.0,"13":2.0,"14":3.0,"15":1.0,"16":243.0,"17":0.358024691,"18":0.75617284,"19":0.0,"20":29.0,"21":27.0,"22":0.0,"23":2.0,"24":2.0,"25":0.0,"26":6.0,"27":26.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":55.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":77,"statCategoryRanking":593,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.21913671},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.9263052},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":-1.1117501},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":-1.1103017},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.5976197}],"totalRanking":1327,"totalRating":-3.9651134}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":32686,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":8,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":513,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[9,5,12,16,17],"firstName":"Albert","fullName":"Albert Almora Jr.","id":32686,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"5","lastName":"Almora Jr.","ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":262.65893271461715,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":5.631067961165049,"percentStarted":4.660194174757281},"proTeamId":16,"seasonOutlook":"Almora set career highs in games (152), starts (94) and plate appearances (479) last season.

Yet, his HR/FB dropped precipitously from 11.0 percent to 4.8 percent. Power isn't his game, but since Almora also doesn't run, he needs every modicum of production he can muster.

The veteran outfielder struggled mightily when on the field, slashing .180/.278/.298 with eight homers and five stolen bases in 334 plate appearances. With three years and $49.5 million left on his contract, Fowler is expected to open the season as the Cardinals' starting right fielder.
