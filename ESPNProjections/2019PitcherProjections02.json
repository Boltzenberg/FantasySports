topped 70 innings for the fourth time in five seasons in 2018, racking up 17 saves for the Mets before a midseason trade to Oakland. His strikeout rate jumped after the deal (11.5 K/9) and the A's altered his fastball mix by having him throw more four-seamers and fewer two-seamers, but his slider continues to generate most of his whiffs. After becoming a free agent for the first time in his career this offseason, Familia returned to the Mets on a three-year, $30 million deal. Interestingly enough, he chose to re-sign with his old club after they acquired Edwin Diaz from Seattle, which likely puts Familia in a setup role unless the Mets elect to mix and match their late-inning arms and forgo the use of a traditional closer. Without regular save opportunities, Familia doesn't miss enough bats or post ratios good enough to offer much value, outside of leagues that value holds.

A series of setbacks eventually led to a decision to shut him down for good in September, at which point the injury was called a bone bruise. In November, Morrow had arthroscopic surgery on his right elbow, and while the procedure was referred to as a cleanup, he will not begin throwing until February at the earliest and is expected to miss at least the first month of the regular season. Morrow's strikeout and swinging-strike rate dropped last season as the Cubs reduced the use of his slider and cutter, perhaps in an effort to keep him healthy. His injury history likely limits him to a traditional closer role when he's able to pitch, as it's unlikely that he would be asked to get more than three outs on a regular basis.

His 204.2 innings were the seventh most in the majors. However, his already-pedestrian strikeout rate fell to 17.5 percent, the lowest mark since that of his rookie season. The southpaw maintained excellent control and kept the ball in the yard, but a low strikeout total hurts his fantasy potential. The drop in strikeouts was supported by a dip in swinging-strike rate, also its nadir since Keuchel's freshman campaign. For the past several seasons, Keuchel has benefited from Minute Maid Park, stealthily one of the top pitching venues in the game. Keuchel can still be a fantasy asset, but he needs to be backed by solid infield defense, as an extreme groundball rate remains his bread and butter.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":32.0,"33":32.0,"34":594.0,"35":832.0,"36":0.0,"37":195.0,"38":0.255235602,"39":58.0,"40":0.0,"41":1.277777778,"42":2.0,"43":0.306490385,"44":88.0,"45":83.0,"46":18.0,"47":3.753383703,"48":153.0,"50":10.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":12.0,"54":10.0,"55":0.545454545,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":1.0,"63":19.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":2.637931034,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":53,"statCategoryRanking":84,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.12636395},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":0.73058444},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":1.5750765},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":1.9398265},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":194,"totalRating":3.8722901}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":36133,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":11,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":7,"rank":168,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,15,16,17],"firstName":"A.J.","fullName":"A.J.

Smith's final-month struggles, perhaps caused by fatigue, do cast a hint of doubt upon his ability to hold up as an elite fantasy closer for a full 162-game schedule, but if he can stay on the mound, he has a skill set that's borderline top-10-worthy at the position.

In retrospect, it's perhaps understandable why he never emerged as the Arizona Diamondbacks' closer, though he certainly possesses the stuff to do it should the team choose him in the future. Bradley strangely struggled against right-handed hitters in 2018, as they batted .272/.314/.481 against him, so he'll need to address that if he's to capture a ninth-inning role and develop into a top-line fantasy closer. But even if he's again the primary eighth-inning guy, something that seems likely with Greg Holland now on board, Bradley should contribute useful ratios and a good strikeout total in leagues that reward middle relievers.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":71.0,"33":0.0,"34":219.0,"35":305.0,"36":0.0,"37":67.0,"38":0.243636364,"39":27.0,"40":2.0,"41":1.287671233,"42":3.0,"43":0.318032787,"44":31.0,"45":30.0,"46":8.0,"47":3.738712901,"48":74.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"52":0.0,"53":2.0,"54":6.0,"55":0.25,"56":31.0,"57":27.0,"58":4.0,"59":0.870967742,"60":4.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":2.740740741,"83":31.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":73,"statCategoryRanking":167,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":0.686887},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":0.37683016},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":0.32188988},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":0.16694985},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":0.19722855}],"totalRanking":350,"totalRating":1.7497854}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":28817,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":6,"rank":177,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"J.A.","fullName":"J.A.

He spent the first four months with the Rangers, posting the worst ratios of his career (4.72 ERA, 1.37 WHIP) but with a strikeout rate that recovered from a dismal 2017 (6.4 K/9) offering a glimmer of hope after the Cubs acquired him in July. A slight uptick in velocity and an increased reliance on his four-seam fastball, paired with an escape from a hitter-friendly home park accompanied a huge stretch run, as he posted a 2.36 ERA and 1.10 WHIP over his 12 starts with Chicago. After the trade, Hamels' home run rate dropped, as his HR/FB was nearly cut in half to 10.9 percent. The Cubs picked up Hamels' $20 million option for 2019 in November, and he appears to have the tools necessary to be the team's best starting pitcher this season, thanks to an excellent changeup and a very good curveball that still induce plenty of whiffs.

He's a useful source of ERA, WHIP and strikeouts but would need a lights-out spring to be considered one of the top setup options out there.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":59.0,"33":0.0,"34":174.0,"35":237.0,"36":0.0,"37":45.0,"38":0.216346154,"39":26.0,"40":1.0,"41":1.224137931,"42":2.0,"43":0.308016878,"44":18.0,"45":16.0,"46":3.0,"47":2.552733197,"48":56.0,"50":9.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":3.0,"54":3.0,"55":0.5,"56":3.0,"57":1.0,"58":2.0,"59":0.333333333,"60":17.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":2.153846154,"83":18.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":107,"statCategoryRanking":217,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":0.18755892},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":0.46915874},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.33683646},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.27626932},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":0.78931105}],"totalRanking":440,"totalRating":0.83292294}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":32667,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":5,"rank":200,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Kevin","fullName":"Kevin Gausman","id":32667,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"45","lastName":"Gausman","lastNewsDate":1547209363000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.7142857142857143,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":207.50462962962962,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":77.13178294573643,"percentStarted":73.44961240310077},"proTeamId":15,"seasonOutlook":"Gausman has long been hailed a fantasy breakthrough candidate, but it wasn't until his July trade to the Atlanta Braves that he finally seemed to realize his position.

To that point, his 2.85 overall ERA was second-best in franchise history, trailing only Marvin Freeman's 2.80 in 1984, during which he worked only 112 2/3 innings, and his 2.40 ERA at Coors set a new franchise mark. Now for the bad news: Freeland's 82.8 left on base percentage says he's bound to regress in the ERA department in 2019, and he got a lot of advantageous calls that threatens his numbers across the board if he doesn't get the same breaks, as he had a major league-leading 139 strikes on pitches thrown outside the zone. Even with his five-pitch mix that's above-average at minimizing hard contact, he's still closer to a matchups type than one to lock in as a repeat top-25 fantasy starting pitcher. Roll him back about 20-25 spots and you're adjusting appropriately for inevitable regression, though he can still help you despite being a Rockies pitcher.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":32.0,"33":32.0,"34":579.0,"35":815.0,"36":0.0,"37":195.0,"38":0.268225585,"39":71.0,"40":2.0,"41":1.378238342,"42":6.0,"43":0.333742331,"44":91.0,"45":87.0,"46":21.0,"47":4.051681917,"48":146.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"52":1.0,"53":11.0,"54":10.0,"55":0.523809524,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":17.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":2.056338028,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":17,"statCategoryRanking":20,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":0.5882069},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":2.3416765},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":1.8964064},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":3.0478745},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":54,"totalRating":7.627331}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":36063,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":11,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":4,"rank":210,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,15,16,17],"firstName":"Jose","fullName":"Jose Alvarado","id":36063,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"46","lastName":"Alvarado","lastNewsDate":1549999468000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":1.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":216.41666666666666,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":71.31782945736434,"percentStarted":67.05426356589147},"proTeamId":30,"seasonOutlook":"Alvarado was by far the Tampa Bay Rays' most effective relief pitcher last season, and since the team lacks an obvious choice for the ninth inning, he has to be considered the odds-on favorite to get the bulk of their save chances.

That Alvarado was so dominant against right-handed hitters -- .163/.262/.233 rates allowed -- only affirms his candidacy to close despite his left-handedness.

While fatigue might've been a factor in his decline, Newcomb needs to work on getting strike one if he's truly to make a push for the upper tiers of the fantasy starting pitcher pool.

Quintana's problems centered around being left in games too long. His ERA jumped from 2.97 to 3.59 to 7.15 with each turn through a lineup. Opponents hit .329 against him, and he had an abysmal 5.0 K-BB% the third time through a lineup.

Quintana had no such troubles in 2017, but he has every other year.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":32.0,"33":32.0,"34":552.0,"35":769.0,"36":0.0,"37":171.0,"38":0.246397695,"39":64.0,"40":3.0,"41":1.277173913,"42":5.0,"43":0.312093628,"44":83.0,"45":80.0,"46":23.0,"47":3.927933217,"48":171.0,"50":3.0,"51":0.0,"52":4.0,"53":12.0,"54":8.0,"55":0.6,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":18.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":2.671875,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":57,"statCategoryRanking":96,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.15764147},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":0.17797442},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":1.655409},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":2.161436},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":209,"totalRating":3.5903447}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":33158,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":3,"rank":231,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Marco","fullName":"Marco Gonzales","id":33158,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"7","lastName":"Gonzales","lastNewsDate":1541082685000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.42857142857142855,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":234.77546296296296,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":61.82170542635659,"percentStarted":57.751937984496124},"proTeamId":12,"seasonOutlook":"Gonzales, once a top prospect with the St. Louis Cardinals, finally broke through as a member of the Seattle Mariners in 2018, at a stage in his career where he had almost entirely been written off for fantasy purposes.

Gonzales cooled to the tune of a 5.93 ERA thereafter, his increased workload -- his 166 2/3 innings were only 43 fewer than he had in 2015-17 combined -- a likely explanation. Far better control, as his 4.7 percent walk rate was a professional best, gives him an excellent chance at a repeat, or better, a step forward in 2019.

Givens did have a 3.37 ERA, 1.17 WHIP and 27.8 percent strikeout rate the past three years combined, and those might be reasonable expectations for him again in 2019.

Gray continues to post strong skills metrics, including well-above-average strikeout and ground ball rates, so there's no reason to completely avoid him despite the nightmare that was his 2018.

Underneath the uptick in fantasy value, Strop posted his lowest strikeout rate since 2012 (23.8 percent), and hitters were able to put the ball in the air against him more frequently, snapping a four-year stretch in which he maintained a ground ball rate above 50 percent (46.1). Strop's ratios are at risk if he's unable to slow his declining strikeout rate. However, since Morrow is expected to miss at least the first month of the season, Strop is the favorite to open 2019 as the Cubs' closer and see plenty of save chances until Morrow is ready to return.

Teheran has historically been tough on righties, and he held them to a career-low .182 average last season, but he did allow 15 of his 26 homers to righties. His overall numbers, however, are troublesome. He had a sub-4.00 ERA in spite of a high walk rate and high home run rate, thanks in large part to a BABIP that was more than 50 points below his career norm.

A jump in walk rate as well as opponents' batting average led to a big jump in ERA and WHIP from 2017 to 2018. Godley's best pitch is his curveball, and he threw it 40 percent of the time in 2018, which helped him finish ninth in the National League in strikeouts. A large portion of Godley's troubles in 2018 came when he faced hitters for a third time in a game; he had a 9.20 ERA the third time through a lineup, allowing seven home runs, while batters hit .293/.382/.478 against him in those situations. Godley was much better in those situations in 2017, almost too good to believe, and the regression bit him hard in 2018. This is a case where less usage should lead to better results.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":31.0,"33":31.0,"34":525.0,"35":755.0,"36":0.0,"37":171.0,"38":0.259484067,"39":77.0,"40":3.0,"41":1.417142857,"42":10.0,"43":0.341721854,"44":91.0,"45":86.0,"46":17.0,"47":4.413436164,"48":173.0,"50":17.0,"51":1.0,"52":0.0,"53":10.0,"54":9.0,"55":0.526315789,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":15.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":2.246753247,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":83,"statCategoryRanking":147,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":-1.3582531},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":-1.0000069},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":2.0892043},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":2.6046553},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":312,"totalRating":2.088766}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":31221,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":1,"rank":262,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Tyler","fullName":"Tyler Skaggs","id":31221,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"45","lastName":"Skaggs","lastNewsDate":1547200818000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.42857142857142855,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":250.29861111111111,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":47.86821705426357,"percentStarted":43.21705426356589},"proTeamId":3,"stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":28.0,"33":28.0,"34":438.0,"35":619.0,"36":0.0,"37":140.0,"38":0.250447227,"39":46.0,"40":0.0,"41":1.273972603,"42":5.0,"43":0.308562197,"44":67.0,"45":63.0,"46":16.0,"47":3.893566273,"48":150.0,"50":3.0,"51":0.0,"52":1.0,"53":9.0,"54":7.0,"55":0.5625,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":16.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":3.260869565,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":89,"statCategoryRanking":155,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.21341936},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":0.14296697},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":1.1894807},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":1.0533882},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":326,"totalRating":1.9255831}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":33696,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":1,"rank":264,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Carlos","fullName":"Carlos Rodon","id":33696,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"55","lastName":"Rodon","lastNewsDate":1550327789000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.42857142857142855,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":248.9212962962963,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":45.93023255813954,"percentStarted":38.17829457364341},"proTeamId":4,"seasonOutlook":"September 2017 shoulder surgery cost Rodon the first two months of last season and slowed him in his first five starts of the year, but for a brief period midseason he looked like the promising prospect he was in 2015-16.

Rodon's sluggish finish to the year cast doubts upon the extent of his bounce-back potential entering 2019, as his average fastball velocity declined slightly in each of the past two seasons.

A positive sign was that he ended a disturbing three-year decline in velocity, as each of his pitches saw a slight uptick in average velocity in 2018. He is still a groundball-heavy pitcher, but his misses now get his harder than they did in his heyday with the Cubs. He is no longer the ace that can go deep into a game (5.53 ERA the third time through an order), and should not be drafted as such.

Green has closer-worthy skills, and while he probably won't be the New York Yankees' first choice for the ninth inning -- and might be more like their sixth- or seventh-inning man -- he could be quite a helpful pitcher for ratios and K's even in mixed formats.

Blisters have been especially problematic for him, as he has made six trips combined to the disabled list for them since the 2016 All-Star break, and his 39 years of age won't give him any greater odds of avoiding them in 2019. Fortunately, Hill's 3.03 ERA, 0.94 WHIP and 29.6 percent strikeout rate in 13 second-half starts -- plus staying healthy for its entirety -- eased any worry about his full-season rate regression, making him the same high-risk, high-reward player he has been since he joined the Los Angeles Dodgers.

When on the hill, DeSclafani incurred a serious case of gopheritis, surrendering 24 homers in just 115 frames. His HR/FB ballooned to 19.8 percent, well above league average. While some regression is likely, DeSclafani needs to improve his location and sequencing, especially against left-handed batters. His velocity and K% ticked up a bit, though his swinging-strike rate remained the same.
