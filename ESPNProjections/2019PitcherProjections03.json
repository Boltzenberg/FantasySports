job.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":59.0,"33":0.0,"34":162.0,"35":237.0,"36":0.0,"37":44.0,"38":0.218905473,"39":30.0,"40":4.0,"41":1.37037037,"42":2.0,"43":0.320675105,"44":27.0,"45":25.0,"46":7.0,"47":4.17541921,"48":66.0,"50":4.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":1.0,"54":5.0,"55":0.166666667,"56":31.0,"57":27.0,"58":4.0,"59":0.870967742,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":2.2,"83":27.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":25,"statCategoryRanking":72,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.40755028},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.14584595},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":0.25762388},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.054659735},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":4.4898267}],"totalRanking":171,"totalRating":4.1393948}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":32804,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":321,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Zach","fullName":"Zach

by better career splits with men on base, Wood decided to work exclusively from the stretch last season. While things didn't go as well as hoped, Wood's ERA estimators weren't too removed from previous campaigns. The main difference was losing a tick of velocity, resulting in a dip in swinging strikes and K%. The oft-injured southpaw avoided the disabled list, though he was given extra rest on several occasions, including three times after leaving a start early due to hamstring cramping. The Dodgers again transitioned Wood to the bullpen in advance of their playoff run. Acquired by the Reds in the offseason, Wood is expected to be a rotation mainstay. Still, planning on more than 170 frames is aggressive. Despite being a ground ball pitcher, expect Wood to surrender more homers in the Great American Ball Park, losing some streaming appeal. Buyer beware, there's now performance risk on top of workload concerns.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":28.0,"33":28.0,"34":471.0,"35":652.0,"36":0.0,"37":144.0,"38":0.242016807,"39":47.0,"40":6.0,"41":1.216560509,"42":8.0,"43":0.305214724,"44":71.0,"45":64.0,"46":17.0,"47":3.655618688,"48":151.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"52":1.0,"53":11.0,"54":6.0,"55":0.647058824,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":17.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":3.212765957,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":54,"statCategoryRanking":88,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":0.79052275},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":0.6626958},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":1.2858796},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":1.2749978},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":199,"totalRating":3.7672625}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":32697,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":327,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Lucas","fullName":"Lucas Giolito","id":32697,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"27","lastName":"Giolito","lastNewsDate":1550234879000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":258.912037037037,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":7.945736434108527,"percentStarted":6.007751937984496},"proTeamId":4,"stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":32.0,"33":32.0,"34":522.0,"35":762.0,"36":0.0,"37":153.0,"38":0.231467474,"39":86.0,"40":1.0,"41":1.373563218,"42":12.0,"43":0.329396325,"44":93.0,"45":88.0,"46":26.0,"47":4.550722112,"48":142.0,"50":14.0,"51":0.0,"52":1.0,"53":9.0,"54":10.0,"55":0.473684211,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":15.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":1.651162791,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":239,"statCategoryRanking":622,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":-1.6058925},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":-3.2055748},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":1.1252146},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":1.4966074},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":1000,"totalRating":-2.4364786}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":32569,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":11,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":328,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,15,16,17],"firstName":"Collin","fullName":"Collin McHugh","id":32569,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"31","lastName":"McHugh","lastNewsDate":1547218246000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.14285714285714285,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":239.47222222222223,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":36.82170542635659,"percentStarted":28.68217054263566},"proTeamId":18,"seasonOutlook":"Research reveals there's about a 17 percent difference between skills as a starter and reliever.

He set personal bests last season in terms of FIP (3.22) and strikeout rate (28.8 percent). Maeda's ability to shift between roles actually seems to work to his disadvantage, though in his defense, he's next in line behind a rotation that does have its share of injury risks (Clayton Kershaw, Rich Hill, Hyun-Jin Ryu). If he's shaping up as a starter at the time of your draft, he's a good back-of-your-staff mixed-league pick, but even if he begins in relief, at the moment he moves back into a starter's role, he'd be well worth the

a significant stretch last summer, Stripling was the Dodgers' best starting pitcher. While some of that was simply due to the myriad of injuries to the rest of the rotation, from May 12 through August 9, Stripling registered a 2.80 ERA with a 1.05 WHIP. He struck out 97 batters while walking only eight in those 86.2 innings. He started 21 games last year, throwing a career-high 122 innings. Even so, the 29-year-old right-hander is again ticketed to spend the 2019 campaign in a swing role, beginning the season in the bullpen but remaining a rotation option. Stripling possesses a starter's repertoire, throwing four different pitches at least 10 percent of the time. He's not overpowering, sitting at 92 mph and touching 95. However, his pinpoint control makes him effective, regardless of his role. When he's in the rotation, Stripling is an automatic start. As a reliever, he's useful given his assistance in the ratio and strikeout areas.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":46.0,"33":20.0,"34":441.0,"35":607.0,"36":0.0,"37":142.0,"38":0.249122807,"39":32.0,"40":4.0,"41":1.183673469,"42":1.0,"43":0.28830313,"44":60.0,"45":57.0,"46":18.0,"47":3.499269514,"48":150.0,"50":4.0,"51":0.0,"52":1.0,"53":10.0,"54":6.0,"55":0.625,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":6.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":4.6875,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":45,"statCategoryRanking":66,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":0.785544},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":1.346068},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":1.301946},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":1.0533882},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":165,"totalRating":4.2401133}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":30147,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":359,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Jhoulys","fullName":"Jhoulys Chacin","id":30147,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"45","lastName":"Chacin","lastNewsDate":1539270720000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":254.49883990719258,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":19.805825242718445,"percentStarted":11.844660194174757},"proTeamId":8,"seasonOutlook":"The Brewers quietly added Chacin last offseason for two years at $15.5 million and, when 2018 was over, it could be argued he had the best contract handed out to any pitcher in free agency. Chacin pitched well for the second-straight year and set career-highs with 35 starts and 15 wins. Plus, the 1.16 WHIP he posted was easily the best of his career. The reason for his success was a slider that rated as one of the best pitches in all of baseball in 2018, according to FanGraphs. After ending last season as the Brewers' top pitcher, Chacin is assured a spot in the club's rotation for as long as he is healthy. He will be a free agent again after 2019, giving him extra motivation to continue pitching at a high level. Chacin doesn't rack up the strikeouts like some of his counterparts do, but nearly everything else in his profile points to his being a bargain -- both on the field and in fantasy -- for a third year in a row.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":32.0,"33":32.0,"34":531.0,"35":743.0,"36":0.0,"37":159.0,"38":0.244239631,"39":65.0,"40":3.0,"41":1.265536723,"42":10.0,"43":0.314939435,"44":80.0,"45":74.0,"46":21.0,"47":3.788023932,"48":144.0,"50":5.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":11.0,"54":9.0,"55":0.55,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":19.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":2.215384615,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":27,"statCategoryRanking":39,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":1.3934269},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":1.1074481},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":1.623276},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":2.6046553},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":86,"totalRating":6.4819727}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":32029,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":11,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":363,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,15,16,17],"firstName":"Kelvin","fullName":"Kelvin Herrera","id":32029,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"41","lastName":"Herrera","lastNewsDate":1550336013000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":257.2638888888889,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":11.434108527131784,"percentStarted":8.333333333333334},"proTeamId":4,"seasonOutlook":"The Royals used Herrera as their closer to begin the season, and he pitched very well in that role, carrying a 1.05 ERA, 0.82 WHIP and an impressive 22 K's and just two walks in 25 2/3 innings before he was flipped to the Nationals in June. Although he had a brief opportunity to close in Washington when Sean Doolittle was on the DL, a shoulder injury sent Herrera to the shelf in early August before a season-ending foot injury shut him down for good later that month. A first-time free agent during the offseason, Herrera signed a two-year deal with the White Sox in January. He's expected to compete with Alex Colome for save chances. Herrera had surgery to repair a torn ligament in his foot in September, but he should arrive to spring training in February without restrictions assuming everything has gone as planned with his rehab.

Despite an elite strikeout rate (35.3 percent) and better than average control (7.4 walk percentage), Peacock worked 58 percent of the time in low-leverage situations, compared to 18 percent in high-leverage scenarios. Houston's loaded bullpen played a part, as did an elevated 1.5 HR/9. Despite his success in relief, Peacock is expected to prepare as a starter this season. Even if Peacock winds up back in the bullpen, he could still rack up 100 whiffs, which would give him value in formats where dominant relievers are valuable. If he does earn a spot in the rotation, he could turn out to be quite the find later in drafts, as he posted a 3.22 ERA and 10.9 K/9 during 21 starts in 2017.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":62.0,"33":0.0,"34":237.0,"35":331.0,"36":0.0,"37":67.0,"38":0.225589226,"39":32.0,"40":0.0,"41":1.253164557,"42":3.0,"43":0.3081571,"44":36.0,"45":33.0,"46":11.0,"47":3.763746736,"48":93.0,"50":4.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":3.0,"54":6.0,"55":0.333333333,"56":2.0,"57":0.0,"58":2.0,"59":0.0,"60":13.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":2.90625,"83":13.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":71,"statCategoryRanking":163,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":0.5292486},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":0.47072905},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":0.65928626},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.054659735},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":0.19722855}],"totalRanking":343,"totalRating":1.8018328}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":40913,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":370,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Dereck","fullName":"Dereck

worked primarily in a multi-inning relief role last season, throwing 101.1 innings while starting just five times. He finished with an excellent 2.66 ERA and his first three career saves. Lugo's curveball was always intriguing due to its very high spin rate, but he'd been unable to translate that into a high strikeout rate in his first two big-league seasons. Last year, that number jumped up to 25.1 percent. There's been talk he will get a chance to compete for a rotation spot in spring training, but Lugo is now 29 and has a middling 4.06 career ERA as a starter, compared to a 2.38 mark as a reliever. It seems more likely that Lugo will pitch mostly out of the bullpen again this season. Working in shorter stints helps a lot of pitchers, and there's reason to believe that Lugo's breakout is mostly sustainable, though even a modest step back could push him back toward the glob of mostly interchangeable middle

Hildenberger was never officially branded the Twins \"closer of the future,\" he did log saves at every level while progressing through the Minnesota system. Even after a solid rookie campaign in 2017, Hildenberger entered last year only third in line for saves, behind Fernando Rodney and Addison Reed. He managed to record 18 holds with seven saves, despite pitching significantly worse than in his freshman campaign. The sidewinding right-hander's K-rate dropped four points to 21.9 percent, while his BB-rate more than doubled to 8.2 percent. That said, torpedoed by a low 66.1 percent LOB-rate, Hildenberger's 3.80 xFIP and 3.73 SIERA make the argument that his actual 5.42 ERA was out of sync with his true skill level. Hildenberger doesn't exhibit the usual split disparity characteristic of a sidearm delivery, boding well for his chances of continuing to see high-leverage work. However, even though his deception and movement induce a 12.4 percent swinging-strike mark, he's not likely to figure in the Twins' ninth-inning plans.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":65.0,"33":0.0,"34":204.0,"35":287.0,"36":0.0,"37":65.0,"38":0.25,"39":20.0,"40":6.0,"41":1.25,"42":3.0,"43":0.306620209,"44":33.0,"45":31.0,"46":8.0,"47":4.151753971,"48":67.0,"50":2.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":2.0,"54":6.0,"55":0.25,"56":15.0,"57":10.0,"58":5.0,"59":0.666666667,"60":17.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":3.35,"83":27.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":153,"statCategoryRanking":278,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.35930574},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.9969985},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":0.24155739},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":0.16694985},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":0.78931105}],"totalRanking":539,"totalRating":-0.15848589}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":37515,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":11,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":392,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,15,16,17],"firstName":"Brandon","fullName":"Brandon Woodruff","id":37515,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"53","lastName":"Woodruff","lastNewsDate":1550176131000,"lastVideoDate":1538706298000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":259.9396751740139,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":4.466019417475728,"percentStarted":3.495145631067961},"proTeamId":8,"stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":28.0,"33":28.0,"34":453.0,"35":640.0,"36":0.0,"37":146.0,"38":0.254799302,"39":69.0,"40":1.0,"41":1.42384106,"42":7.0,"43":0.346875,"44":85.0,"45":79.0,"46":19.0,"47":4.682224505,"48":138.0,"50":9.0,"51":1.0,"52":0.0,"53":8.0,"54":9.0,"55":0.470588235,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":13.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":2.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":134,"statCategoryRanking":250,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":0.32439014},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":0.24518493},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.127972},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.054659735},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.0988127}],"totalRanking":497,"totalRating":0.28813064}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":29238,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":393,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Wade","fullName":"Wade LeBlanc","id":29238,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"49","lastName":"LeBlanc","lastNewsDate":1538177006000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":257.43981481481484,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":6.782945736434108,"percentStarted":4.457364341085271},"proTeamId":12,"seasonOutlook":"Many fantasy baseball enthusiasts spent much of last summer waiting for the wheels to fall off LeBlanc's chariot. Considering all the ERA estimators pegged his ERA at least half a run higher, the pessimism was warranted. Granted, it was in almost 100 fewer innings, but LeBlanc's 2017 peripherals with Pittsburgh are an almost exact match to last season in Seattle (19.6 percent strikeout rate, 6.0 percent walk rate), yet his ERA with the Pirates was 4.50 compared to 3.72 with the Mariners. LeBlanc should come close to repeating the underlying skills, but he'll be hard-pressed to post an ERA below 4.00 again. Still, with an Opening Day rotation spot virtually assured, LeBlanc is in play in AL-only formats as well as a consideration in mixed leagues where he can be deployed mainly at home in pitcher-friendly T-Mobile Park.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":30.0,"33":30.0,"34":495.0,"35":676.0,"36":0.0,"37":159.0,"38":0.253184713,"39":41.0,"40":1.0,"41":1.212121212,"42":3.0,"43":0.300295858,"44":81.0,"45":73.0,"46":23.0,"47":3.959895225,"48":130.0,"50":1.0,"51":0.0,"52":1.0,"53":10.0,"54":8.0,"55":0.555555556,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":16.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":3.170731707,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":52,"statCategoryRanking":78,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":1.0738107},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":0.6328953},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":1.2055471},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":1.2749978},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":186,"totalRating":3.9404178}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":34240,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":11,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":394,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,15,16,17],"firstName":"Jace","fullName":"Jace Fry","id":34240,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"57","lastName":"Fry","lastNewsDate":1538025024000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":260.0,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":2.7131782945736433,"percentStarted":2.131782945736434},"proTeamId":4,"stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":72.0,"33":0.0,"34":165.0,"35":229.0,"36":0.0,"37":43.0,"38":0.209756098,"39":21.0,"40":0.0,"41":1.163636363,"42":1.0,"43":0.283842795,"44":25.0,"45":23.0,"46":5.0,"47":3.681835367,"48":69.0,"50":5.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":2.0,"54":4.0,"55":0.333333333,"56":5.0,"57":2.0,"58":3.0,"59":0.4,"60":15.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":3.285714286,"83":17.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":109,"statCategoryRanking":219,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":0.6148308},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.13832319},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":0.24155739},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.27626932},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":0.34524918}],"totalRanking":444,"totalRating":0.7870448}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":30963,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":11,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":396,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,15,16,17],"firstName":"Steve","fullName":"Steve Cishek","id":30963,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"41","lastName":"Cishek","lastNewsDate":1537042166000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":259.2180974477958,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":4.271844660194175,"percentStarted":3.6893203883495147},"proTeamId":16,"seasonOutlook":"Cishek didn't disappoint in his first season with the Cubs, immediately sliding into a high-leverage relief role and leading the team with 25 holds while producing a shiny 2.18 ERA and 1.04 WHIP.

While Cishek saw his walk rate climb to 9.7 percent, the sidewinder simultaneously enjoyed a resurgence in his strikeout rate, fanning 27.1 percent of the batters he faced. Cishek has now outperformed his FIP in each of the past three seasons.

deluge of injuries to the Angels' pitching staff afforded Barria an opportunity in the big-league rotation early on in the season. The rookie wound up making 26 starts for the big club, finishing 10-9 with a respectable 3.41 ERA. The estimators suggest Barria was nearly a run worse than his actual ERA (4.58 FIP, 4.99 xFIP), as the right-hander benefitted from a low BABIP (.271) and a high strand rate (82.1 percent). He was far from dominant with a 6.8 K/9, 3.3 BB/9 and 1.2 HR/9. Barria showed reverse splits in his rookie season, holding lefties to a .614 OPS but getting tagged by righties (.824 OPS). Given the Angels' underwhelming rotation depth, Barria should get a chance to build on his 2018

2017, the Phillies peddled Neshek to the Rockies at the break, but the veteran returned to the City of Brotherly Love as a free agent last season. After averaging 67 appearances over the previous four years, Neshek worked in only 30 contests in 2018, as his debut was delayed until July 1 with a sore shoulder and forearm strain. As usual, the sidewinding righty was more effective against same-side hitters, holding righty swingers to a .551 OPS, compared to a .900 mark versus lefties. With his low strikeout rate and innings, Neshek needs saves -- or holds in leagues using them -- to be fantasy-useful. He logged five saves and six holds last season. He's much more likely to increase the holds total in 2019.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":66.0,"33":0.0,"34":165.0,"35":217.0,"36":0.0,"37":49.0,"38":0.240196078,"39":10.0,"40":3.0,"41":1.072727273,"42":0.0,"43":0.271889401,"44":19.0,"45":17.0,"46":8.0,"47":2.807551726,"48":49.0,"50":1.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":2.0,"54":4.0,"55":0.333333333,"56":4.0,"57":2.0,"58":2.0,"59":0.5,"60":13.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":4.9,"83":15.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":130,"statCategoryRanking":245,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":0.23962261},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":0.42874125},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.64209986},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.054659735},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":0.4932698}],"totalRanking":482,"totalRating":0.4648741}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":41017,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":11,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":410,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,15,16,17],"firstName":"Caleb","fullName":"Caleb Ferguson","id":41017,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"64","lastName":"Ferguson","lastNewsDate":1540280374000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":260.0,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":1.5533980582524272,"percentStarted":0.970873786407767},"proTeamId":19,"stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":46.0,"33":0.0,"34":204.0,"35":276.0,"36":0.0,"37":59.0,"38":0.231372549,"39":18.0,"40":1.0,"41":1.132352941,"42":2.0,"43":0.286231884,"44":25.0,"45":23.0,"46":8.0,"47":2.987552346,"48":73.0,"50":2.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":3.0,"54":5.0,"55":0.375,"56":4.0,"57":2.0,"58":2.0,"59":0.5,"60":14.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":4.055555556,"83":16.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":69,"statCategoryRanking":159,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":0.5518628},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":0.34792957},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":0.06482594},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":0.8317786},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":0.04920793}],"totalRanking":336,"totalRating":1.8456049}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":30369,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":11,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":411,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,15,16,17],"firstName":"Bud","fullName":"Bud Norris","id":30369,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"26","lastName":"Norris","lastNewsDate":1538209287000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":259.7192575406032,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":2.912621359223301,"percentStarted":2.1359223300970873},"proTeamId":24,"seasonOutlook":"For the second straight season, a second-half swoon cost Norris his closing gig. Still, in today's transient ninth-inning landscape, that doesn't preclude Norris from garnering saves for his third team in three years, though he'll likely need to first prove himself in a setup role. Norris' 27 percent strikeout rate as a reliever is worthy of high-leverage duties. However, inconsistent control and home run woes are a concern. Over the past two seasons, 12 of Norris' 19 homers allowed have come after the break, despite throwing almost 30 fewer innings in that span. Norris' xFIP the past two seasons has been 3.65 and 3.66, with even better 3.60 and 3.30 SIERA marks, emphasizing his need to keep the ball in the yard. If Norris lands in a homer-suppressing venue, he's worthy of consideration in the speculative/handcuff closer tier.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":58.0,"33":0.0,"34":174.0,"35":249.0,"36":0.0,"37":55.0,"38":0.25,"39":24.0,"40":3.0,"41":1.362068965,"42":3.0,"43":0.329317269,"44":29.0,"45":27.0,"46":7.0,"47":4.214859668,"48":63.0,"50":8.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":3.0,"54":3.0,"55":0.5,"56":5.0,"57":4.0,"58":1.0,"59":0.8,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":2.625,"83":4.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":19,"statCategoryRanking":59,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":0.19151658},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":0.34198835},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":0.1933579},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.054659735},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":3.8977442}],"totalRanking":148,"totalRating":4.5699472}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":29446,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":11,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":412,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,15,16,17],"firstName":"Mark","fullName":"Mark Melancon","id":29446,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"41","lastName":"Melancon","lastNewsDate":1544657608000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":260.0,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":2.912621359223301,"percentStarted":2.5242718446601944},"proTeamId":26,"seasonOutlook":"After a series of arm issues derailed his first season with the Giants, Melancon opened the 2018 campaign on the disabled list with an elbow flexor strain.

Will Smith figures to open the year as the Giants' closer, but Melancon is still owed $28 million over the next two seasons, so he'll likely hang around the end-of-game conversation and could step into the ninth-inning role should Smith get hurt or dealt to a contender.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":45.0,"33":0.0,"34":129.0,"35":182.0,"36":0.0,"37":45.0,"38":0.266272189,"39":12.0,"40":1.0,"41":1.325581395,"42":1.0,"43":0.318681319,"44":18.0,"45":16.0,"46":3.0,"47":3.388161579,"48":37.0,"50":4.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":1.0,"54":4.0,"55":0.2,"56":10.0,"57":7.0,"58":3.0,"59":0.7,"60":11.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":3.083333333,"83":18.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":203,"statCategoryRanking":352,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.7127548},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":0.3935264},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.38503593},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.4978789},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":0.19722855}],"totalRanking":648,"totalRating":-1.0049146}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":31945,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":11,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":413,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,15,16,17],"firstName":"Trevor","fullName":"Trevor Rosenthal","id":31945,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"44","lastName":"Rosenthal","lastNewsDate":1550341066000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":260.0,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":1.941747572815534,"percentStarted":1.5533980582524272},"proTeamId":20,"seasonOutlook":"Rosenthal enters 2019 as an unknown quantity after he had to miss the entire 2018 campaign as he recovered from Tommy John surgery. He didn't even pitch in the minors, relying on a 36-pitch showcase with over 40 scouts in attendance to display his wares. Rosenthal reportedly touched 98 mph on the radar gun, mixing in a high-80s changeup and slider. The Nationals were impressed enough to sign him to a deal that includes a 2020 vesting option. Washington hopes Rosenthal can step in and set up closer Sean Doolittle. From 2014-2017, Rosenthal logged 117 saves for St. Louis before tearing his UCL. Rosenthal's career 13.1 percent swinging-strike rate is elite, but control has been an ongoing issue -- and is the biggest concern coming back from this procedure. With Doolittle's injury history, Rosenthal could be a popular speculative closer (or a handcuff), provided he maintains the velocity shown in his October tryout.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":48.0,"33":0.0,"34":135.0,"35":202.0,"36":0.0,"37":38.0,"38":0.219653179,"39":25.0,"40":0.0,"41":1.4,"42":2.0,"43":0.321782178,"44":20.0,"45":19.0,"46":4.0,"47":3.787704494,"48":69.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":2.0,"54":3.0,"55":0.4,"56":6.0,"57":4.0,"58":2.0,"59":0.666666667,"60":9.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":2.76,"83":13.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":0,"statCategoryRanking":0,"statRankings":[],"totalRanking":0,"totalRating":0.0}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":30089,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":11,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":414,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,15,16,17],"firstName":"Hector","fullName":"Hector Rondon","id":30089,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"30","lastName":"Rondon","lastNewsDate":1539349958000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":259.65277777777777,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1547472881702,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":3.682170542635659,"percentStarted":2.9069767441860463},"proTeamId":18,"stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":61.0,"33":0.0,"34":171.0,"35":237.0,"36":0.0,"37":52.0,"38":0.23853211,"39":18.0,"40":1.0,"41":1.228070175,"42":1.0,"43":0.299578059,"44":24.0,"45":22.0,"46":7.0,"47":3.549249877,"48":63.0,"50":1.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":2.0,"54":4.0,"55":0.333333333,"56":5.0,"57":2.0,"58":3.0,"59":0.4,"60":13.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":3.5,"83":15.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":60,"statCategoryRanking":134,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.0720997},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":0.59571826},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":0.1933579},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.27626932},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":1.973476}],"totalRanking":284,"totalRating":2.4141831}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1550563200000}]}
