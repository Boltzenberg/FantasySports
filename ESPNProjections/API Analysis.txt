Coming off an absurd .306/.372/.751 hitting line with 31 home runs in 66 games following his July 2017 trade to the Arizona Diamondbacks, Martinez signed a five-year deal with the Boston Red Sox in late February, only to arguably improve his statistics in 2018. He boosted his contact rate by more than three full percentage points and his already-elite hard contact rate by nearly four percentage points, resulting in the fifth-best season using rotisserie scoring and 13th-best using points-based scoring. At 31, Martinez has a skill set that is among the most rock solid of any slugger, as he makes contact nearly three-quarters of the time, makes hard contact roughly 50 percent of the time he puts the ball in play, and possesses the most outstanding all-field power of anyone in baseball, with a league-leading (by an 11-homer margin) 38 home runs to the opposite field the past two seasons combined. He's also a heart-of-the-order hitter in one of the deepest lineups in baseball, meaning he's as good a Triple Crown contender as you'll find. This is a building-block, first-round player.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":560.0,"1":181.0,"2":0.323214286,"3":37.0,"4":2.0,"5":41.0,"6":80.0,"7":101.0,"8":345.0,"9":0.616071429,"10":65.0,"11":9.0,"12":3.0,"13":6.0,"14":7.0,"15":1.0,"16":635.0,"17":0.392125984,"18":1.008197413,"19":0.0,"20":103.0,"21":121.0,"22":0.0,"23":5.0,"24":1.0,"25":4.0,"26":19.0,"27":150.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":149.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":2,"statCategoryRanking":3,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":4.2276015},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":3.571104},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":2.581055},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":3.335596},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":0.31481755}],"totalRanking":4,"totalRating":14.030174}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":28976,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":33,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":false,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Max","fullName":"Max Scherzer","id":28976,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"31","lastName":"Scherzer","lastNewsDate":1552400817000,"lastVideoDate":1537935024000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":39.280834914611006,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":5.130601634067839,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":98.62745748101979,"percentStarted":97.0692570367669},"proTeamId":20,"seasonOutlook":"Move over, Clayton Kershaw, it's Scherzer's game now. Scherzer has been a model of durability and consistency for nearly a decade now, and in the past six seasons alone, he has finished among the top five in his league's Cy Young balloting each year while winning three times, and he has been the No. 1 or 2 starting pitcher in rotisserie leagues four times. During that same time (2013-18), he has 11 more wins, 11 more quality starts and 134 more strikeouts than any other pitcher, and his 2.81 ERA and 0.97 WHIP rank third and second (among pitchers with at least 600 innings pitched). What's more, Scherzer raised the bar in terms of strikeouts last season, reaching the 300-K plateau to become only the 14th pitcher to strike out at least that many during the expansion era (since 1961). If there are any concerns about his future, it's that he's 34 and one of the bigger fly ball pitchers in the game, putting him at risk of costly home runs. With no sign of Scherzer slipping, though, he's almost indisputably the No. 1 pitcher in any league format, and there's a compelling case for him to be the first pick overall in a points-based league.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":32.0,"33":32.0,"34":636.0,"35":831.0,"36":0.0,"37":155.0,"38":0.203145478,"39":52.0,"40":3.0,"41":0.976415094,"42":10.0,"43":0.261131167,"44":63.0,"45":60.0,"46":25.0,"47":2.548564109,"48":274.0,"50":4.0,"51":1.0,"52":0.0,"53":18.0,"54":6.0,"55":0.75,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":2.0,"63":27.0,"64":1.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":5.269230769,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":1,"statCategoryRanking":1,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":4.3278384},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":3.1155922},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":3.9368513},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":3.269484},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":3,"totalRating":14.402934}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":30948,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":29,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":false,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Chris","fullName":"Chris Sale","id":30948,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"41","lastName":"Sale","lastNewsDate":1552276096000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":34.78409090909091,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":9.186207750402376,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":98.56538410683591,"percentStarted":95.83168055004627},"proTeamId":2,"seasonOutlook":"Only a persistent bout with shoulder inflammation during the second half of last season served as an obstacle to Sale challenging for the honor of No. 1 pitcher in fantasy, and that he managed to finish 18th on the Player Rater and 12th in terms of fantasy points despite pitching only 158 innings is a testament to his otherworldly skills. He managed at least a 30 percent strikeout rate for the fourth time, his walk rate was under 6 percent for a sixth consecutive season, and he surrendered hard contact (per Statcast) on only 27 percent of his balls in play, fourth best among pitchers with at least 25 starts. In short, Sale showed little to no sign of loss of skill due to the ailment, with a roughly 1.5 mph drop in average fastball velocity being the most noticeable effect. That does make him a pitcher more worth tracking, health-wise, during spring training than the others ranked in his range, but it's not enough to drop him from the top three among starters in any fantasy format.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":31.0,"33":31.0,"34":585.0,"35":769.0,"36":0.0,"37":149.0,"38":0.209859155,"39":41.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.974358974,"42":14.0,"43":0.265279584,"44":60.0,"45":56.0,"46":20.0,"47":2.606538041,"48":260.0,"50":4.0,"51":0.0,"52":1.0,"53":17.0,"54":5.0,"55":0.772727273,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":26.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":6.341463415,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":7,"statCategoryRanking":9,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":3.7709193},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":3.0366962},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":2.924662},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":1.9398265},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":19,"totalRating":11.425271}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":32796,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":27,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":false,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Jacob","fullName":"Jacob deGrom","id":32796,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"48","lastName":"deGrom","lastNewsDate":1551545857000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":33.34535104364326,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":12.179499876206982,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":98.63986199575372,"percentStarted":96.97452229299363},"proTeamId":21,"seasonOutlook":"No pitcher in the history of baseball has experienced a more dominating season that failed to result in bushels of wins for his real-life team than deGrom, and as a testament to how much the game has progressed, he won the National League's Cy Young Award (and nearly unanimously at that) despite totaling 10 wins. Among deGrom's feats: He led the majors in ERA (1.70), quality starts (28, tied) and FIP (1.99), and he finished in the top four in WHIP, WAR, K's and batting average allowed. He also set a single-year record with 24 consecutive quality starts. Further illustrating the folly of the \"win\": deGrom's 19 quality starts that failed to result in an individual win set a single-season record, and bear in mind that he pitched at least seven innings in 15 of those, demonstrating how unusually unlucky he was. For his encore, deGrom might not enjoy quite so much good fortune in terms of BABIP (.283 in 2018, 13 points beneath his career mark), left-on-base percentage (82.0, more than three percentage points beneath his career rate) or home run/fly ball percentage (6.0, nearly three percentage points beneath his career number), so his ERA and WHIP are sure to increase slightly. His surging swinging-strike rate supports his candidacy as one of the top pitchers in baseball (and fantasy baseball), and he's sure to be even slightly more fortunate in the win column, considering his New York Mets should be more competitive.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":32.0,"33":32.0,"34":639.0,"35":840.0,"36":0.0,"37":170.0,"38":0.218790219,"39":54.0,"40":3.0,"41":1.051643192,"42":4.0,"43":0.271428571,"44":68.0,"45":62.0,"46":19.0,"47":2.638485087,"48":250.0,"50":2.0,"51":0.0,"52":1.0,"53":16.0,"54":8.0,"55":0.666666667,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":1.0,"63":27.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":4.62962963,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":3,"statCategoryRanking":3,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":4.257079},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":4.6617723},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":3.4387898},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":1.4966074},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":7,"totalRating":13.607417}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":30583,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":9,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":26,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":false,"eligibleSlots":[8,10,5,12,16,17,11],"firstName":"Giancarlo","fullName":"Giancarlo Stanton","id":30583,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"27","lastName":"Stanton","lastNewsDate":1538306026000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":30.03201506591337,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":17.25303142786439,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":98.49693759311373,"percentStarted":97.59311372289356},"proTeamId":10,"seasonOutlook":"Stanton's first season in pinstripes fell short of expectations, but in his defense, that's partly because the bar had been set so high after he enjoyed career totals that were by far career bests with 59 home runs and 692 plate appearances in his 2017 National League MVP campaign, then moved to one of the game's biggest homer havens. In what was an overlooked development, he played in 158 games (topped only by his 2017 season) and came to the plate 705 times (a career high), which is promising for a player whose early career was plagued by injuries. Stanton also seemed to click after an initial adjustment to the league change, batting .276/.353/.532 with 33 home runs after May 1 (which prorates to 40 over a full season), so the case can be made he should be better in Yankee Year No. 2. With the injury concerns somewhat quelled, the greatest complaint about Stanton these days is his penchant for strikeouts, though his prodigious power coupled with a solid walk rate makes him every bit as strong in points-based leagues as rotisserie.

He has exceeded the 200-innings threshold in three of his past four seasons, answering any injury questions from his past, and has excellent odds of being a top-10 fantasy starter for the second consecutive year.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":32.0,"33":32.0,"34":597.0,"35":806.0,"36":0.0,"37":159.0,"38":0.216621253,"39":59.0,"40":0.0,"41":1.095477387,"42":6.0,"43":0.277915633,"44":79.0,"45":70.0,"46":25.0,"47":3.167478087,"48":245.0,"50":9.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":15.0,"54":7.0,"55":0.681818182,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":1.0,"63":22.0,"64":1.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":4.152542373,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":8,"statCategoryRanking":10,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":2.7657363},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":2.27286},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":3.5512555},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":2.6046553},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":21,"totalRating":10.947674}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":33748,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":21,"rank":31,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Blake","fullName":"Blake Snell","id":33748,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"4","lastName":"Snell","lastNewsDate":1552320446000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":24.46212121212121,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":31.433081589699146,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":98.54658879745155,"percentStarted":96.76798513405893},"proTeamId":30,"seasonOutlook":"A major league-leading 21 wins and American League-best 1.89 ERA was plenty for Snell to capture Cy Young honors, and the scary part is that his skill set might actually still be improving.

Since Syndergaard's big league debut May 12, 2015, he ranks sixth in ERA (2.93), 14th in strikeout rate (27.1 percent) and 15th in WHIP (1.13) with a minimum of 350 innings.

That is despite the fact that he had many memorable moments, such as his victory in the Los Angeles Dodgers' \"Game 163\" that earned them the National League West title. Almost every one of his underlying skills metrics was extraordinary: 27.9 percent strikeout rate, 6.8 percent walk rate, 50.7 ground ball rate, 30.8 percent hard-hit rate, with all of those grading much better than league-average. Buehler also didn't sustain an exhausting workload as a rookie, totaling 177 innings between the minors, major-league regular season and postseason, though that did still represent a 79-inning increase over his 2017 number. Even if he's to face adjustments as hitters begin to become more familiar with him, or if he suffers even the slightest amount of fatigue, his skills are too valuable to ignore. If we had the promise of 200-plus innings, Buehler might be a locked in as top-10 starter in all fantasy formats. Yes, he has that much potential.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":31.0,"33":31.0,"34":552.0,"35":733.0,"36":0.0,"37":152.0,"38":0.228571429,"39":59.0,"40":2.0,"41":1.14673913,"42":6.0,"43":0.296043656,"44":68.0,"45":63.0,"46":18.0,"47":3.097782882,"48":198.0,"50":6.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":14.0,"54":6.0,"55":0.7,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":22.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":3.355932203,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":22,"statCategoryRanking":30,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":2.599767},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":2.0237658},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":1.5429435},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":1.0533882},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":74,"totalRating":6.973031}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":31313,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":17,"rank":46,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Patrick","fullName":"Patrick Corbin","id":31313,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"46","lastName":"Corbin","lastNewsDate":1551570895000,"lastVideoDate":1543962304000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":18.64516129032258,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":47.37092980066856,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":98.36130698182541,"percentStarted":95.63015195153442},"proTeamId":20,"seasonOutlook":"Few pitchers in the game possess as good a slider as Corbin -- his in 2018 was the ninth-best slider in a single year in the 17-year span for which FanGraphs has such data -- and he only improved his chances for success when he added a curveball that got swings and misses nearly 2 percent more often than the league's average.

Better yet: Diaz converted 27 of 28 save chances with a 1.15 ERA, 0.64 WHIP and 47.9 percent K rate in the Seattle Mariners' final 81 games of 2018, at a time when most might've assumed he'd be more likely to fade after having made 41 appearances in the team's first 81 games.

Diaz is well worth being one of the -- if not the -- first closers off your board.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":68.0,"33":0.0,"34":207.0,"35":274.0,"36":0.0,"37":44.0,"38":0.177419355,"39":21.0,"40":1.0,"41":0.942028985,"42":5.0,"43":0.255474453,"44":18.0,"45":17.0,"46":7.0,"47":2.238634498,"48":105.0,"50":3.0,"51":1.0,"52":0.0,"53":4.0,"54":4.0,"55":0.5,"56":42.0,"57":39.0,"58":3.0,"59":0.928571429,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":5.0,"83":39.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":1,"statCategoryRanking":5,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":2.268528},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":1.6891761},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":1.1091481},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.7194885},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":8.190342}],"totalRanking":12,"totalRating":12.537705}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":32185,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":11,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":16,"rank":59,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,15,16,17],"firstName":"Blake","fullName":"Blake Treinen","id":32185,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"39","lastName":"Treinen","lastNewsDate":1549119851000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":14.585227272727273,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":65.53623188405797,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":98.0328412672085,"percentStarted":97.04760325095373},"proTeamId":11,"seasonOutlook":"Treinen's strong finish to 2017 -- 12-of-13 in save chances with a 2.51 ERA in the final two months -- carried over nicely into the past season, in which he raised the bar further with the second-best-among-closers fantasy season using either Rotisserie or points-based scoring. Thanks in large part to increased fastball and sinker velocity following his mid-2017 trade to the Oakland Athletics, he posted personal bests in 2018 in strikeout rate (31.8 percent), total strikeouts (100) and FIP (1.82). That's not to mention that he recorded the fourth-best ERA (0.78) of any reliever in history with a minimum of 60 innings pitched. Treinen elevated his ground ball rate during the season's second half to a rate more in range with his days in Washington without giving back any of his swing-and-miss gains, signs that his skill set is that of a locked-in, top-five fantasy closer.

Greinke lost more than a full mile per hour on his average fastball velocity last season, and his slider declined slightly as he generated a 33.2 percent whiff rate with it (44.5 percent in 2017). Now 35, Greinke still has three above-average offerings and good control, which should make his decline a graceful one. Another season with a low-to-mid 3.00s ERA and a sub-1.20 WHIP is attainable, but run support might be a significant issue, as the supporting cast has taken a hit with the departures of Paul Goldschmidt and A.J.

Strasburg posted a sub-3 ERA in eight of the 14 months in which he made at least five starts in that same time, which is an unusual level of consistency for a pitcher with his health risk.

That was in large part thanks to his significantly ramping up his slider usage, throwing the pitch 25 percent of the time from June 1 forward, an important distinction considering he had 16 quality starts, 12 wins, a 2.63 ERA and a 1.15 WHIP in his final 21 starts of the season. While many might assume he will regress in 2019, considering his track record and inexperience, Taillon might actually have room for growth.

A below-average BABIP helped keep base runners in check, and he continued to excel at keeping the ball in the yard, allowing only two homers in 51.1 innings. Durability remains an issue, as Chapman failed to reach 60 innings for the fourth time in five seasons, missing a month late in the second half with a sore left knee after dealing with tendinitis in the same knee periodically over the summer.

However, his low save totals in New York reflect missing time as well as the club's willingness to look elsewhere when Chapman's control gets him into trouble.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":58.0,"33":0.0,"34":165.0,"35":224.0,"36":0.0,"37":31.0,"38":0.160621762,"39":26.0,"40":1.0,"41":1.036363636,"42":4.0,"43":0.272321429,"44":16.0,"45":15.0,"46":4.0,"47":2.37988521,"48":92.0,"50":9.0,"51":0.0,"52":1.0,"53":3.0,"54":3.0,"55":0.5,"56":41.0,"57":38.0,"58":3.0,"59":0.926829268,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":3.538461538,"83":38.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":10,"statCategoryRanking":33,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":0.80211914},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":0.9445409},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":0.6110868},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.054659735},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":4.4898267}],"totalRanking":78,"totalRating":6.792914}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":33263,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":15,"rank":68,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Luis","fullName":"Luis Severino","id":33263,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"DAY_TO_DAY","jersey":"40","lastName":"Severino","lastNewsDate":1552083776000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":17.702651515151516,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":55.89723907391358,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":98.18820178198801,"percentStarted":91.78563147958},"proTeamId":10,"seasonOutlook":"A tale of two seasons: Severino's 2.31 first-half ERA made him a Cy Young candidate, but his 5.57 second-half number made him virtually useless for fantasy purposes, with the minus-3.26 differential the worst decline by any ERA-qualified pitcher in 2018.

Flaherty is now a locked-in member of the team's starting five, and though he might seemed primed for another step forward, keep in mind that he could use some work on his control -- 9.6 percent walk rate in the majors -- and perhaps stamina, having never pitched more than 182 2/3 innings in any of his five professional campaigns.

Kershaw has averaged 27 starts and 183 1/3 innings during the past five seasons, has made five disabled-list trips during that time, and has missed 28.5 percent of the Los Angeles Dodgers' schedule while on the DL in the past three years alone. What's more, while before 2018 he had provided undeniably-best-in-the-game statistics in his healthy stints, there were hints of slight skills erosion last year: His average fastball velocity dipped to a career-low 91.3 mph (he ranged from 93-94 mph in the previous three years) and opponents batted .299/.335/.509 with a .367 wOBA against the pitch (all career-worst rates), forcing him to rely much more heavily on his slider, and the result was a 23.9 percent overall strikeout rate for the season, his lowest since his rookie 2008. Kershaw has also battled shoulder issues early in spring training, further clouding his outlook. When he was healthy for the Dodgers' final 81 team games of 2018, he went 15-for-16 in quality starts with a 2.67 ERA and 0.99 WHIP, a performance that carries top-10 potential in any fantasy format if he can put his injuries behind him. There are more durable alternatives in that tier these days, though.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":25.0,"33":25.0,"34":483.0,"35":632.0,"36":0.0,"37":148.0,"38":0.247491639,"39":36.0,"40":0.0,"41":1.142857143,"42":1.0,"43":0.292721519,"44":62.0,"45":55.0,"46":18.0,"47":3.092179662,"48":163.0,"50":10.0,"51":1.0,"52":2.0,"53":12.0,"54":6.0,"55":0.666666667,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":18.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":4.527777778,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":20,"statCategoryRanking":28,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":2.2661655},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":2.1354177},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":1.6072094},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":1.2749978},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":72,"totalRating":7.0369573}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":32693,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":11,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":14,"rank":82,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,15,16,17],"firstName":"Roberto","fullName":"Roberto Osuna","id":32693,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"54","lastName":"Osuna","lastNewsDate":1551545064000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":12.320075757575758,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":86.86271837442696,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":96.85955894544851,"percentStarted":95.28436411871995},"proTeamId":18,"seasonOutlook":"A 75-game suspension for violating MLB's Joint Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault and Child Abuse policy cost Osuna a significant chunk of 2018, though the Houston Astros were nevertheless willing to trade for him around midseason, thrusting him back into a closer's job shortly after his return to eligible status.

He's proven he can be quite effective; just keep in mind there's still an injury risk. In addition, playoff heroes often incur a ranking bump from recency bias. Last season's 3.58 ERA was light according to the sabermetric ERA estimators, suggesting a correction toward 4.00. In addition, he maintained the same strikeout rate as the previous couple of campaigns, despite a marked drop in swinging-strike rate. If Price doesn't revert, he could see a reduction in strikeouts. To help mitigate these potential issues, Price can reduce homers allowed, as he posted a high 13.2 percent HR/FB last season. Price is still a front-end fantasy starter, but he comes with more risk than last October may suggest.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":30.0,"33":30.0,"34":543.0,"35":747.0,"36":0.0,"37":165.0,"38":0.241935484,"39":50.0,"40":0.0,"41":1.187845304,"42":9.0,"43":0.299866131,"44":80.0,"45":74.0,"46":23.0,"47":3.69054729,"48":180.0,"50":1.0,"51":0.0,"52":1.0,"53":13.0,"54":7.0,"55":0.65,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":1.0,"63":18.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":3.6,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":23,"statCategoryRanking":31,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":1.4904798},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":0.9083412},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":1.9606724},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":2.8262649},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":75,"totalRating":6.9389253}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":31077,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":11,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":11,"rank":95,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,15,16,17],"firstName":"Brad","fullName":"Brad Hand","id":31077,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"33","lastName":"Hand","lastNewsDate":1550348430000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":10.996219281663516,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":92.40359133126935,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":97.3076923076923,"percentStarted":95.88196286472149},"proTeamId":5,"seasonOutlook":"A midseason trade to the Cleveland Indians, who mixed and matched with him and Cody Allen in the ninth inning during the season's final two months, might've been the only thing standing in Hand's path to a top-five fantasy closer performance in 2018.

It also had a lot to do with Yates boosting his ground ball rate to 43.2 percent, that almost entirely at the expense of costly fly balls, meaning that his advances were probably mostly sustainable. He should begin the season as the Padres' closer and has a skill set worthy of top-10 consideration at that position, although the franchise's tendency to aggressively trade relief pitchers in noncontending seasons does make him a slight risk for a midseason move into a setup role elsewhere. It's not a particularly likely move, with the Padres perhaps not far off contender mode, but we must provide the warning.

While he got off to a somewhat sluggish start, that coming on the heels of a forgettable first half-year back in the majors in 2017, he rode increased fastball velocity and pro-career-best control to one of the strongest second halves of any player in baseball. Wheeler won nine of 11 starts -- remember, fellow rotation-mate Jacob deGrom couldn't buy a win -- with a 1.68 ERA, 0.81 WHIP, 25.7 percent strikeout and 5.3 percent walk rates after the All-Star break, which illustrated the possibility he could provide top-25 fantasy starter production in 2019. It's probably wiser to regard him more of a top-40 option at his position, though, as he might take a small step backwards in 2019 after pitching 182 1/3 innings, a large year-over-year jump, and a .284 BABIP.

Marquez burst onto the scene with huge numbers during the team's final 82 games of 2018: 15-for-17 in quality starts, nine wins, 2.47 ERA, 0.95 WHIP, 33.3 percent strikeout and 5.0 percent walk rates. He got there thanks in large part to his perfecting a slider, which he used minimally in 2017 but nearly 25 percent of the time during the aforementioned time span, as well as a renewed approach that included significantly boosting his first-pitch strike percentage (68.9 percent during that time, seventh-best among 64 qualifiers). With those skills bumps, Marquez became a true rarity, a matchups-proof Rockies pitcher, albeit one who did still suffer the effects of Coors Field over the full season (4.74 ERA).

That said, there's a latent trend in terms of innings pitched, as he has gone from an average of 6.44 innings pitched per start in 2016, to 5.94 in 2017, to 5.78 last season. Some of that may be due to the Yankees building an uber-bullpen, but it's also because Tanaka gives up a high percentage of his homers the third time through the order. Homers are so variable, especially in Yankee Stadium, and with a few more, we're looking at a league-average ERA. A few less, and we have a borderline ace. As alluded to, Tanaka's career 23.9 strikeout and 4.8 walk rates provide a solid fantasy floor with a solid WHIP and strikeout total. An aggressive ranking on Tanaka is a bet he keeps the ball in the yard.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":30.0,"33":30.0,"34":519.0,"35":709.0,"36":0.0,"37":161.0,"38":0.243939394,"39":37.0,"40":0.0,"41":1.14450867,"42":6.0,"43":0.287729196,"44":79.0,"45":73.0,"46":28.0,"47":3.798503554,"48":176.0,"50":3.0,"51":0.0,"52":2.0,"53":12.0,"54":7.0,"55":0.631578947,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":1.0,"63":17.0,"64":1.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":4.756756757,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":35,"statCategoryRanking":47,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":1.4714137},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":0.5729149},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":1.6714755},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":1.9398265},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":119,"totalRating":5.4087973}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":5904,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":3,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":9,"rank":118,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[1,7,19,12,16,17,11],"firstName":"Edwin","fullName":"Edwin Encarnacion","id":5904,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"10","lastName":"Encarnacion","lastNewsDate":1551120940000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":8.267419962335216,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":112.9663449641178,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":96.21504101195771,"percentStarted":90.95431037322528},"proTeamId":12,"seasonOutlook":"Encarnacion has been one of the most consistently elite power hitters in baseball for nearly a decade now, as he is the only player in the game to have hit at least 30 home runs in each of the past seven seasons, and he is the major league leader (by nine) in the category in those seven years. Unfortunately, as a 36-year-old who was traded to the Seattle Mariners in the offseason, he's a riskier pick this year than he has been in the recent past. His contact rate has steadily dropped during the past half-decade, and his supporting cast is considerably weaker entering 2019, negatively influencing his runs and RBIs (and perhaps his plate appearances).

Yes, Phillies manager Gabe Kapler does like to mix and match with his bullpen, so Robertson might not get every save chance, but the right-hander is easily his top talent and should earn the team's runaway lead in the category.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":65.0,"33":0.0,"34":204.0,"35":275.0,"36":0.0,"37":47.0,"38":0.192622951,"39":26.0,"40":3.0,"41":1.073529412,"42":1.0,"43":0.269090909,"44":23.0,"45":21.0,"46":8.0,"47":2.718930823,"48":93.0,"50":1.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":3.0,"54":5.0,"55":0.375,"56":30.0,"57":27.0,"58":3.0,"59":0.9,"60":7.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":3.576923077,"83":34.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":27,"statCategoryRanking":79,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":1.1385608},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":0.6733077},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":0.5789538},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":1.0533882},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":0.4932698}],"totalRanking":187,"totalRating":3.9374804}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":32760,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":11,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":8,"rank":127,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,15,16,17],"firstName":"Josh","fullName":"Josh Hader","id":32760,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"71","lastName":"Hader","lastNewsDate":1551923597000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":7.335863377609108,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":122.88407233093882,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":96.49809318520975,"percentStarted":93.46045431935002},"proTeamId":8,"seasonOutlook":"Hader's 2018 was a season for the ages: He whiffed a major-league-leading 46.7 percent of the batters he faced, the fourth-best rate by any pitcher with at least 50 innings pitched in a single season in history, and he had 18 appearances of at least two innings pitched without allowing a run, the most by any pitcher in six years.

He maintained the same excellent fastball and sinker velocity he has exhibited since 2016, and he finished in the 84th percentile in terms of minimizing hard contact.

Part of the problem is that he possesses an elite slider -- which explains the strikeouts -- but his other offerings just haven't made the cut, though that screams \"faulty command\" more than anything. One can only wonder whether his being pitted with pitching coach/guru Ray Searage might pay bigger dividends for Archer in 2019, though after so many years of disappointment, fantasy managers might understandably be hesitant to trust him. The K's alone make Archer a top-40 starter candidate, and there's always the chance he could finally raise the performance bar with a National League team and in a pitching-friendly home ballpark.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":32.0,"33":32.0,"34":549.0,"35":781.0,"36":0.0,"37":179.0,"38":0.251758087,"39":59.0,"40":2.0,"41":1.300546448,"42":6.0,"43":0.312419974,"44":94.0,"45":85.0,"46":23.0,"47":4.161851106,"48":203.0,"50":6.0,"51":0.0,"52":1.0,"53":10.0,"54":10.0,"55":0.5,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":17.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":3.440677966,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":105,"statCategoryRanking":190,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.59290045},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24334654},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":1.719675},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":0.610169},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":395,"totalRating":1.2467636}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":35124,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":7,"rank":139,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Luis","fullName":"Luis Castillo","id":35124,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"58","lastName":"Castillo","lastNewsDate":1552027095000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":5.74573055028463,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":144.02922600619195,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":93.71562976214139,"percentStarted":88.14351023653349},"proTeamId":17,"seasonOutlook":"Suffice it to say that the buzzworthy-entering-2018 Castillo was one of the season's bigger disappointments, with his average fastball velocity declining by roughly 1.5 mph. Many of his fantasy managers lost their patience with him as he posted a 5.85 ERA and four quality starts in his first 17 turns. Some of that should be chalked up to the inevitable adjustment period young pitchers face in the bigs, and in Castillo's defense, he kicked said velocity back up to 96.5 mph in his final 14 starts, during which time he had a 2.63 ERA. He still possesses one of the game's most deceptive changeups, and carries much of the same promise he did a year ago, when he was drafted the No. 28 starting pitcher on average in ESPN leagues. After the proven aces are off the board, Castillo has one of the most appealing skill sets among starting pitchers and is a solid midround pick.

Hinch during the team's 2017 World Series triumph over the Dodgers. After he had posted back-to-back seasons with an elite strikeout rate, Giles' rate dropped to 25 percent in 2018, but he offset the missing whiffs by reducing his walk rate to a career-low 3.3 percent (career 7.4 percent). His inconsistency and an on-field verbal blow-up when Hinch removed him from a game in July prompted the Astros to send Giles to Toronto when they acquired Roberto Osuna from the Blue Jays. Giles' ratios improved after the trade, but his home-run rate spiked (1.83 HR/9). Giles still has an elite slider, which he used to generate a 51.2 percent whiff rate last season, but the effectiveness of his fastball waned with a slight drop in velocity (98.2 to 97.3 mph). He should have every opportunity to lock down the ninth-inning role for the Jays this season, and if he can improve his fastball command and reduce his home run rate, Giles still has a shot to be a top-10 closer.

A slight uptick in velocity and an increased reliance on his four-seam fastball, paired with an escape from a hitter-friendly home park accompanied a huge stretch run, as he posted a 2.36 ERA and 1.10 WHIP over his 12 starts with Chicago. After the trade, Hamels' home run rate dropped, as his HR/FB was nearly cut in half to 10.9 percent. The Cubs picked up Hamels' $20 million option for 2019 in November, and he appears to have the tools necessary to be the team's best starting pitcher this season, thanks to an excellent changeup and a very good curveball that still induce plenty of whiffs.

The veteran rebounded well, though he was victimized again, this time by a low strand rate. Porcello's actual 4.28 ERA was about half a run higher than his 3.87 xFIP and the 3.77 mark SIERA predicted. His 1.18 WHIP was the second lowest in his career, bested only by his Cy Young campaign. Porcello's 99 starts the past three seasons were second only to Justin Verlander's 101. However, Porcello fell short of the 200-inning plateau for the first time since 2015. Despite making changes to combat his proclivity for the long ball, Porcello's 1.27 HR/9 was still well above average. The mantra is not to chase wins. However, durable pitchers on high-scoring teams are in a better position to earn victories. Porcello is not flashy, but that keeps the cost reasonable.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":32.0,"33":32.0,"34":582.0,"35":807.0,"36":0.0,"37":187.0,"38":0.252361673,"39":44.0,"40":0.0,"41":1.190721649,"42":15.0,"43":0.304832714,"44":93.0,"45":86.0,"46":25.0,"47":3.995511706,"48":181.0,"50":3.0,"51":1.0,"52":1.0,"53":13.0,"54":9.0,"55":0.590909091,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":1.0,"63":18.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":4.113636364,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":31,"statCategoryRanking":43,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":1.2536901},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24998863},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":2.1695368},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":3.0478745},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":98,"totalRating":5.9742794}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":28957,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":11,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":5,"rank":164,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,15,16,17],"firstName":"Wade","fullName":"Wade Davis","id":28957,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"71","lastName":"Davis","lastNewsDate":1538201203000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":4.140417457305503,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":162.54298810703668,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":93.78807947019868,"percentStarted":90.48344370860927},"proTeamId":27,"seasonOutlook":"Davis racked up 43 saves during his first season with the Rockies, working through a reduced strikeout rate (10.7 K/9) by slightly improving his walk rate (3.6 BB/9) and reaping the benefits of a career-low BABIP (.238). Without an elite strikeout rate, Davis' margin for error is slimmer than that of most, but his ERA (4.13) was nearly a half run higher than his FIP (3.65) thanks to a surprisingly low strand rate (66.9 percent, his lowest mark as a full-time reliever). The selling point with Davis comes from his job security, as the Rockies rarely asked him to get more than three outs at a time and seem content to use him as a traditional closer with $36 million remaining on his contract over the next two seasons.

Bieber then posted a 4.7 percent walk rate that ranked seventh-best and 67.3 percent strike rate that ranked ninth-best in the game from his May 31 big-league debut date forward.

Blisters have been especially problematic for him, as he has made six trips combined to the disabled list for them since the 2016 All-Star break, and his 39 years of age won't give him any greater odds of avoiding them in 2019. Fortunately, Hill's 3.03 ERA, 0.94 WHIP and 29.6 percent strikeout rate in 13 second-half starts -- plus staying healthy for its entirety -- eased any worry about his full-season rate regression, making him the same high-risk, high-reward player he has been since he joined the Los Angeles Dodgers. He won't give you the volume necessary to be a top-50 fantasy starter, but if your league allows maximum flexibility, he can be a pretty handy option when healthy.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":25.0,"33":25.0,"34":411.0,"35":562.0,"36":0.0,"37":115.0,"38":0.228628231,"39":48.0,"40":2.0,"41":1.189781022,"42":9.0,"43":0.306049822,"44":58.0,"45":54.0,"46":20.0,"47":3.560085843,"48":149.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"52":1.0,"53":9.0,"54":6.0,"55":0.6,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":15.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":3.104166667,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":39,"statCategoryRanking":55,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":1.3269365},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":0.6144869},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":1.526877},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":1.7182169},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":139,"totalRating":4.939684}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":36071,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":5,"rank":173,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Nick","fullName":"Nick Pivetta","id":36071,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"43","lastName":"Pivetta","lastNewsDate":1551822658000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":3.299810246679317,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":188.5221052631579,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":72.12799150263884,"percentStarted":60.33790287781724},"proTeamId":22,"seasonOutlook":"Coming off a horribly unlucky 2017, Pivetta broke through with a 3.26 ERA, 1.09 WHIP and 28.8 percent strikeout rate through last season's first two months, only to see that same misfortune strike him the remainder of the way.

The southpaw maintained excellent control and kept the ball in the yard, but a low strikeout total hurts his fantasy potential. The drop in strikeouts was supported by a dip in swinging-strike rate, also its nadir since Keuchel's freshman campaign. For the past several seasons, Keuchel has benefited from Minute Maid Park, stealthily one of the top pitching venues in the game.

The Mariners will keep Kikuchi's workload in check accordingly, as he's scheduled to make roughly 30 starts, with some of them shortened in terms of pitch count.

These days, though, the game's specialization shouldn't significantly depress Kikuchi's value, as he has a good chance at a top-60 fantasy starter year.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":28.0,"33":28.0,"34":447.0,"35":596.0,"36":0.0,"37":130.0,"38":0.23853211,"39":54.0,"40":1.0,"41":1.234899329,"42":4.0,"43":0.315436242,"44":60.0,"45":56.0,"46":16.0,"47":3.409670008,"48":131.0,"50":6.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":10.0,"54":7.0,"55":0.588235294,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":18.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":2.425925926,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":0,"statCategoryRanking":0,"statRankings":[],"totalRanking":0,"totalRating":0.0}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":36063,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":11,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":4,"rank":184,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,15,16,17],"firstName":"Jose","fullName":"Jose Alvarado","id":36063,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"46","lastName":"Alvarado","lastNewsDate":1551900199000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":3.3806818181818183,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":187.45539033457248,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":85.7299926700873,"percentStarted":80.21923102552142},"proTeamId":30,"seasonOutlook":"Alvarado was by far the Tampa Bay Rays' most effective relief pitcher last season, and since the team lacks an obvious choice for the ninth inning, he has to be considered the odds-on favorite to get the bulk of their save chances.

That Alvarado was so dominant against right-handed hitters -- .163/.262/.233 rates allowed -- only affirms his candidacy to close despite his left-handedness. The Rays do like to mix and match in all pitching roles, which will inevitably cap any individual's number of save chances, but Alvarado's odds of a healthy number of them make him a bona fide top-20 fantasy reliever option.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":74.0,"33":0.0,"34":198.0,"35":272.0,"36":0.0,"37":46.0,"38":0.194092827,"39":31.0,"40":4.0,"41":1.166666666,"42":1.0,"43":0.286764706,"44":21.0,"45":19.0,"46":5.0,"47":2.638537844,"48":80.0,"50":2.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":3.0,"54":4.0,"55":0.428571429,"56":35.0,"57":32.0,"58":3.0,"59":0.914285714,"60":2.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":2.580645161,"83":34.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":49,"statCategoryRanking":119,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":0.75668466},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":1.2002892},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":0.40222234},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.4978789},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":0.9373317}],"totalRanking":260,"totalRating":2.798649}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":31549,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":11,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":4,"rank":186,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,15,16,17],"firstName":"Will","fullName":"Will Smith","id":31549,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"13","lastName":"Smith","lastNewsDate":1547201182000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":2.413662239089184,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":199.54770755885997,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":84.07791517085494,"percentStarted":79.41098258210344},"proTeamId":26,"seasonOutlook":"Smith made a stunning recovery from Tommy John surgery last season, showing the same high-strikeout, split-proof performance he did before going under the knife.

From a season-long perspective, his year was full of warning signs, including his 11.4 percent walk rate, 30.8 percent ground ball rate and .353 wOBA allowed to left-handed hitters, all of which were either career worsts since his 2012 rookie campaign. Now with the Los Angeles Angels, Allen is expected to start the season as their closer, and the change of scenery could help him rebound to a degree. Still, his skills have slipped, he's only a borderline top-20 fantasy option at the position, and one whose role is in more jeopardy than most of the pitchers ranked in his range.

Gray continues to post strong skills metrics, including well-above-average strikeout and ground ball rates, so there's no reason to completely avoid him despite the nightmare that was his 2018. He still possesses the ability to provide top-50 fantasy starter numbers if everything clicks, and the good news is that he might not even carry that high a price tag after his past struggles.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":30.0,"33":30.0,"34":504.0,"35":718.0,"36":0.0,"37":170.0,"38":0.260736196,"39":52.0,"40":1.0,"41":1.321428571,"42":7.0,"43":0.318941504,"44":91.0,"45":86.0,"46":20.0,"47":4.606453853,"48":173.0,"50":6.0,"51":1.0,"52":2.0,"53":8.0,"54":11.0,"55":0.421052632,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":14.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":3.326923077,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":94,"statCategoryRanking":166,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.40254483},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":-1.5732921},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":2.0570714},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":1.9398265},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":349,"totalRating":1.7742276}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":31221,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":3,"rank":199,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Tyler","fullName":"Tyler Skaggs","id":31221,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"DAY_TO_DAY","jersey":"45","lastName":"Skaggs","lastNewsDate":1552240587000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":1.1931818181818181,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":226.64982664685488,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":53.64304149295216,"percentStarted":44.20951624644299},"proTeamId":3,"seasonOutlook":"Skaggs' 2018 was more of the same risk/reward performance: He had eight wins, 11 quality starts, a 2.62 ERA, 1.19 WHIP and 25.5 percent strikeout rate in 19 starts through the fourth week of July, but made three trips to the disabled list from July forward totaling 58 days' absence and surrendered 24 runs in 15 1/3 innings in his final five turns.

Ohtani's 27.8 percent strikeout rate is a bit of a concern in terms of repeating his lofty batting average, and his .222/.300/.354 triple-slash line against left-handed pitchers could be a further concern if he's a true regular, but all the chatter about his hitting when he came over from Japan seems entirely valid (if not understated). As for those of you wondering about his pitching prospects in dynasty/keeper leagues, we'll see.

His strikeout rate declined each of the past four seasons, while his opponents' batting average and ERA worsened in each of the past three. A positive sign was that he at least ended a disturbing three-year decline in velocity, as each of his pitches saw a slight uptick in average velocity in 2018. It's also important to note that he pitched with a knee injury down the stretch last season, and there's some hope that offseason surgery has remedied the issue. Arrieta is still a groundball-heavy pitcher, but his misses now get hit harder than they did in his heyday with Chicago. He is no longer the ace that can go deep into a game (5.53 ERA the third time through an order), and should not be drafted as such. The quandary is whether he can decelerate this aging curve he is on and remain effective.

His 3.59 FIP in 19 Pittsburgh Pirates starts in 2018 told the tale: He was extremely unlucky in terms of baserunners scoring (69.2 left-on-base percentage) and had a strikeout rate (20.6 percent) way out of line with his swinging-strike rate (12.7 percent, which was in the upper quarter amongst pitchers with 100-plus innings). Those alone don't guarantee big things for Musgrove in 2019, but they do put him on the spring training \"watch list\" as far as his health and any subtle improvements with his pitch selection. He could be a good bargain pick, albeit more so in NL-only than mixed leagues.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":30.0,"33":30.0,"34":522.0,"35":727.0,"36":0.0,"37":177.0,"38":0.263392857,"39":37.0,"40":3.0,"41":1.229885057,"42":9.0,"43":0.306740028,"44":85.0,"45":80.0,"46":21.0,"47":4.121412847,"48":149.0,"50":7.0,"51":0.0,"52":1.0,"53":10.0,"54":9.0,"55":0.526315789,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":16.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":4.027027027,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":86,"statCategoryRanking":151,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":0.8106861},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":0.09114436},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":0.7235522},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":0.610169},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":321,"totalRating":1.9887185}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":33158,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":3,"rank":207,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Marco","fullName":"Marco Gonzales","id":33158,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"7","lastName":"Gonzales","lastNewsDate":1552160453000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":1.2992424242424243,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":223.12594427244582,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":72.32166534075841,"percentStarted":62.12543092018032},"proTeamId":12,"seasonOutlook":"Gonzales, once a top prospect with the St. Louis Cardinals, finally broke through as a member of the Seattle Mariners in 2018, at a stage in his career where he had almost entirely been written off for fantasy purposes. Thanks to the addition of a cutter as well as significantly greater usage of his curveball, he posted 12 wins, 12 quality starts, a 3.37 ERA and 1.16 WHIP through his first 21 starts of the season. Gonzales cooled to the tune of a 5.93 ERA thereafter, his increased workload -- his 166 2/3 innings were only 43 fewer than he had in 2015-17 combined -- a likely explanation. Far better control, as his 4.7 percent walk rate was a professional best, gives him an excellent chance at a repeat, or better, a step forward in 2019. Gonzales was a top-50 starter last year, and warrants consideration in that tier again on draft day.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":30.0,"33":30.0,"34":513.0,"35":704.0,"36":0.0,"37":175.0,"38":0.265553869,"39":34.0,"40":0.0,"41":1.222222222,"42":6.0,"43":0.305397727,"44":77.0,"45":73.0,"46":18.0,"47":3.865372317,"48":152.0,"50":2.0,"51":0.0,"52":7.0,"53":10.0,"54":9.0,"55":0.526315789,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":1.0,"63":17.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":4.470588235,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":43,"statCategoryRanking":64,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":0.69736165},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":0.21981777},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":1.4465445},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":2.161436},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":160,"totalRating":4.278327}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":39876,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":3,"rank":210,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Joey","fullName":"Joey Lucchesi","id":39876,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"37","lastName":"Lucchesi","lastNewsDate":1551823767000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":1.3833017077798861,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":230.40643962848299,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":50.8141157705855,"percentStarted":39.65242240978268},"proTeamId":25,"seasonOutlook":"Armed with a deceptive delivery and an above-average changeup, Lucchesi posted the third-most strikeouts among rookie starters last season (145).

However, a 50 percent hard-hit rate in May along with favorable Statcast data foreshadowed an impending breakout. From that point until Aug. 26, Morales raked to the tune of .309/.393/.570, culminating in a historical eight-homers-in-seven-games stretch. Morales then struggled the rest of the season, posting a .458 OPS down the stretch. He's begun each of the past four seasons as utility only, but gained first base eligibility in season, playing 18 games at the position last summer. Morales will again be the Blue Jays' primary designated hitter, though he'll likely get more off days than he did in his younger days.

Glasnow threw substantially more first-pitch strikes with the Rays than he ever had with the Pittsburgh Pirates' big club, which made the 8.4 percent walk rate he posted for them look more sustainable as well as the 4.20 ERA and 1.10 WHIP he had in 11 starts seem repeatable (and perhaps even beatable). He'll need to show us he can continue to get ahead in the count in the spring, and if he does, could be one of the year's better breakthrough bets. Just mind the workload: He hasn't exceeded 155 1/3 frames in any professional season and threw 111 2/3 in 2018, so he probably won't be afforded a full-time starter's opportunity.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":30.0,"33":30.0,"34":426.0,"35":596.0,"36":0.0,"37":117.0,"38":0.226305609,"39":73.0,"40":2.0,"41":1.338028169,"42":4.0,"43":0.325503356,"44":64.0,"45":60.0,"46":17.0,"47":3.823380646,"48":171.0,"50":13.0,"51":1.0,"52":1.0,"53":8.0,"54":8.0,"55":0.5,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":17.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":2.342465753,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":108,"statCategoryRanking":218,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":0.19614394},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.15147638},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":1.301946},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.27626932},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":442,"totalRating":0.823511}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":28487,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":2,"rank":218,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Jon","fullName":"Jon Lester","id":28487,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"34","lastName":"Lester","lastNewsDate":1552014124000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":2.6888045540796965,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":185.40826937360734,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":92.74182876802963,"percentStarted":82.56252481143311},"proTeamId":16,"seasonOutlook":"The casual fan will look at Lester's 2018 campaign and see an ace.

Ryu is a useful back-of-your-staff option even in mixed leagues, but don't count on a lot of volume.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":22.0,"33":22.0,"34":345.0,"35":470.0,"36":0.0,"37":109.0,"38":0.250574713,"39":30.0,"40":2.0,"41":1.208695652,"42":2.0,"43":0.3,"44":46.0,"45":42.0,"46":16.0,"47":3.315746231,"48":114.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":8.0,"54":5.0,"55":0.615384615,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":15.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":3.8,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":41,"statCategoryRanking":60,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":1.4468136},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":1.8693521},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":0.5468208},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":0.8317786},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":152,"totalRating":4.447932}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":33839,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":2,"rank":233,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Kyle","fullName":"Kyle Freeland","id":33839,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"DAY_TO_DAY","jersey":"21","lastName":"Freeland","lastNewsDate":1552157683000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":1.6717267552182162,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":220.47833085685983,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":84.23575300806559,"percentStarted":68.65000661113315},"proTeamId":27,"seasonOutlook":"Freeland's was one of 2018's most unexpected success stories, and that he managed a fourth-place finish in the National League Cy Young voting as well as a top-10 big league ranking in terms of WAR as a Colorado Rockies pitcher was nothing short of remarkable. To that point, his 2.85 overall ERA was second-best in franchise history, trailing only Marvin Freeman's 2.80 in 1984, during which he worked only 112 2/3 innings, and his 2.40 ERA at Coors set a new franchise mark. Now for the bad news: Freeland's 82.8 left on base percentage says he's bound to regress in the ERA department in 2019, and he got a lot of advantageous calls that threatens his numbers across the board if he doesn't get the same breaks, as he had a major league-leading 139 strikes on pitches thrown outside the zone. Even with his five-pitch mix that's above-average at minimizing hard contact, he's still closer to a matchups type than one to lock in as a repeat top-25 fantasy starting pitcher.

Of some concern are exaggerated splits, as Choo slashed .293/.405/.506 over the first half, in contrast to .217/.329/.316 during the second half. Perhaps it was due to the hotter-than-normal Texas heat wearing down the 36-year-old veteran. Choo is assured of playing nearly every day when healthy, which he was the past two seasons.

In retrospect, it's perhaps understandable why he never emerged as the Arizona Diamondbacks' closer, though he certainly possesses the stuff to do it should the team choose him in the future. Bradley strangely struggled against right-handed hitters in 2018, as they batted .272/.314/.481 against him, so he'll need to address that if he's to capture a ninth-inning role and develop into a top-line fantasy closer.

While Matz carries some intrigue, he still comes with plenty of risk given his injury history.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":28.0,"33":28.0,"34":444.0,"35":629.0,"36":0.0,"37":139.0,"38":0.246891652,"39":53.0,"40":2.0,"41":1.297297297,"42":8.0,"43":0.317965024,"44":73.0,"45":67.0,"46":20.0,"47":4.092908817,"48":138.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":2.0,"53":8.0,"54":8.0,"55":0.5,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":15.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":2.603773585,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":75,"statCategoryRanking":136,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":0.4642882},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":0.23857547},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":1.55901},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":0.38855943},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":286,"totalRating":2.4035997}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":31053,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":1,"rank":241,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Kyle","fullName":"Kyle Gibson","id":31053,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"44","lastName":"Gibson","lastNewsDate":1551796450000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.5492424242424242,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":251.30303405572755,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":30.657685160605258,"percentStarted":23.320945049110698},"proTeamId":9,"seasonOutlook":"After consecutive seasons of five-plus ERA and sub-18 percent strikeout rates, Gibson finally provided his fantasy managers some production in 2018.

While fatigue might've been a factor in his decline, Newcomb needs to work on getting strike one if he's truly to make a push for the upper tiers of the fantasy starting pitcher pool.

The oft-injured southpaw avoided the disabled list, though he was given extra rest on several occasions, including three times after leaving a start early due to hamstring cramping. The Dodgers again transitioned Wood to the bullpen in advance of their playoff run. Acquired by the Reds in the offseason, Wood is expected to be a rotation mainstay. Still, planning on more than 170 frames is aggressive. Despite being a ground ball pitcher, expect Wood to surrender more homers in the Great American Ball Park, losing some streaming appeal.

While some of that was simply due to the myriad of injuries to the rest of the rotation, from May 12 through August 9, Stripling registered a 2.80 ERA with a 1.05 WHIP. He struck out 97 batters while walking only eight in those 86.2 innings. He started 21 games last year, throwing a career-high 122 innings. Even so, the 29-year-old right-hander is again ticketed to spend the 2019 campaign in a swing role, beginning the season in the bullpen but remaining a rotation option. Stripling possesses a starter's repertoire, throwing four different pitches at least 10 percent of the time. He's not overpowering, sitting at 92 mph and touching 95. However, his pinpoint control makes him effective, regardless of his role. When he's in the rotation, Stripling is an automatic start. As a reliever, he's useful given his assistance in the ratio and strikeout areas.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":46.0,"33":20.0,"34":441.0,"35":607.0,"36":0.0,"37":142.0,"38":0.249122807,"39":32.0,"40":4.0,"41":1.183673469,"42":1.0,"43":0.28830313,"44":60.0,"45":57.0,"46":18.0,"47":3.499298305,"48":150.0,"50":4.0,"51":0.0,"52":1.0,"53":10.0,"54":6.0,"55":0.625,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":6.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":4.6875,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":45,"statCategoryRanking":66,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":0.785544},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":1.346068},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":1.301946},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":1.0533882},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":165,"totalRating":4.2401133}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":34401,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":257,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Matthew","fullName":"Matthew Boyd","id":34401,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"48","lastName":"Boyd","ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.2727272727272727,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":258.009040247678,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":13.560225115721469,"percentStarted":9.194445369476172},"proTeamId":6,"seasonOutlook":"One of the Detroit Tigers' few pitching bright spots in an otherwise miserable 2018, Boyd exhibited a significant shift in his pitch usage, throwing his slider more than three times as often at the expense of his changeup and sinker and resulting in his strikeout rate soaring by nearly four full percent (to 22.4 percent) compared to his 2015-17 number (18.5).

Givens did have a 3.37 ERA, 1.17 WHIP and 27.8 percent strikeout rate the past three years combined, and those might be reasonable expectations for him again in 2019. The problem is that those don't reflect the performance of a typical, top-shelf closer, meaning that you're paying at least as much for his role itself as his talent.

It wasn't a performance far off his career rates at the Triple-A level (.311/.399/.539), but it's worth remembering that he's a mediocre defender who had ridden the minors-to-majors shuttle for quite some time, in an organization rich in talent which also values defense. White could be the favorite for DH at-bats for the Astros entering 2019, but he's a dangerous investment as any more than a mid-range mixed league corner infielder, as his 68-point career wOBA righty/lefty split hints he might be best suited for platoon play, and on the weak side in that event. Make him prove his worth -- and lock down a regular role -- during spring training before inflating your expectations from him.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":515.0,"1":124.0,"2":0.240776699,"3":26.0,"4":2.0,"5":22.0,"6":50.0,"7":74.0,"8":220.0,"9":0.427184466,"10":48.0,"11":0.0,"12":11.0,"13":6.0,"14":7.0,"15":1.0,"16":580.0,"17":0.315517241,"18":0.742701707,"19":0.0,"20":63.0,"21":74.0,"22":0.0,"23":2.0,"24":2.0,"25":0.0,"26":11.0,"27":123.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":144.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":31,"statCategoryRanking":241,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":0.5705005},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":0.32878578},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.23890527},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.32606524},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.5976197}],"totalRanking":486,"totalRating":0.38882652}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":41128,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":265,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Josh","fullName":"Josh James","id":41128,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"DAY_TO_DAY","jersey":"39","lastName":"James","lastNewsDate":1552344711000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.26136363636363635,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":258.93907120743035,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":14.879365502532657,"percentStarted":7.328045854438816},"proTeamId":18,"seasonOutlook":"A 3.23 ERA and 36.3 percent strikeout rate in his 21 starts and two relief appearances combined between Double-A Corpus Christi and Triple-A Fresno last season -- following a winter during which he made conditioning his focus -- earned James a look with the Houston Astros' big club in September and in the ALCS, and he delivered them three worthwhile starts in the limited time.

He couldn't keep up the strong 28.7% strikeout rate he posted in the Royals' bullpen the season before, but that was to be expected. His 20.6% mark last season wasn't great but wasn't far below league average. Combined with good control (5.9 BB%), that makes for a useful major-league starter, one who is expected to start Opening Day for the Rangers. The lefty has some fantasy appeal, especially in deeper formats, though the homer trouble at home last year (1.91 HR/9) leaves him as more of a road streamer. A poor roster overall hurts his chances at wins while his injury history lowers the floor considerably.

Teheran has historically been tough on righties, and he held them to a career-low .182 average last season, but he did allow 15 of his 26 homers to righties. His overall numbers, however, are troublesome. He had a sub-4.00 ERA in spite of a high walk rate and high home run rate, thanks in large part to a BABIP that was more than 50 points below his career norm.

He is in the final year of his deal with Baltimore, which is worrisome because he is a hitter tailor made for the dimensions of Camden Yards. We should safely assume Trumbo will play at least the first half of the season within Baltimore's friendly confines, but the probability of him being dealt away and/or losing playing time will increase as the season wears on.

While Betances probably won't get many save chances, in a bullpen full of closer-capable relievers, he's one of the best options out there for ERA, WHIP and K's.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":68.0,"33":0.0,"34":198.0,"35":274.0,"36":0.0,"37":40.0,"38":0.170940171,"39":30.0,"40":1.0,"41":1.06060606,"42":6.0,"43":0.277372263,"44":20.0,"45":18.0,"46":6.0,"47":2.389573297,"48":114.0,"50":4.0,"51":1.0,"52":0.0,"53":4.0,"54":3.0,"55":0.571428571,"56":5.0,"57":2.0,"58":3.0,"59":0.4,"60":24.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":3.8,"83":26.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":41,"statCategoryRanking":99,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":1.0269663},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":1.0248821},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":0.96454966},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":0.16694985},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":0.34524918}],"totalRanking":213,"totalRating":3.528597}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":32804,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":287,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Zach","fullName":"Zach Eflin","id":32804,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"56","lastName":"Eflin","lastNewsDate":1552167480000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.14231499051233396,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":259.00049523337873,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":12.575148636529711,"percentStarted":7.068123692164613},"proTeamId":22,"seasonOutlook":"Previously never considered much more than a back-of-the-rotation prospect, Eflin added a hint of velocity to his fastball and sharpened his slider in 2018, giving him a chance at further growth this season.

The long ball is usually an issue for fastball/slider pitchers who pound the zone. He's leaned on the (very good) slider, throwing it 39.3 percent of the time last season, but his 91.1 mph fastball has been hit around and he doesn't appear to trust his changeup, using it just 5.9 percent of the time.

While he was extraordinarily fortunate relative to his skill set, evidenced by a .250 BABIP (.310 for his career) and 92.9 left-on-base percentage (80.3 percent career), his career-best 29.8 percent strikeout rate coupled with a 58.2 percent ground-ball rate showed that he indeed recaptured his prior closer-worthy form. Jeffress' ratios are bound to worsen slightly in 2019, but he'll be a candidate for saves in the Brewers' loaded bullpen when the season dawns, making him one of the more interesting speculative relief picks, even in mixed leagues. Consider him a top-30 option at the position, even without the firm promise of save chances.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":68.0,"33":0.0,"34":213.0,"35":290.0,"36":0.0,"37":58.0,"38":0.224806202,"39":27.0,"40":4.0,"41":1.197183098,"42":2.0,"43":0.3,"44":25.0,"45":23.0,"46":6.0,"47":2.862688498,"48":76.0,"50":4.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":3.0,"54":5.0,"55":0.375,"56":19.0,"57":15.0,"58":4.0,"59":0.789473684,"60":20.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":2.814814815,"83":35.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":7,"statCategoryRanking":26,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":1.4354473},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":2.3015263},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":0.5468208},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":1.0533882},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":1.973476}],"totalRanking":68,"totalRating":7.3106585}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":34842,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":297,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Michael","fullName":"Michael Fulmer","id":34842,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"32","lastName":"Fulmer","lastNewsDate":1552162600000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.18181818181818182,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":258.1992569659443,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":11.243153526970953,"percentStarted":5.9850622406639005},"proTeamId":6,"seasonOutlook":"Injuries have taken a toll on Fulmer, as he has battled elbow, oblique and now knee issues during the past year-and-a-half of his three-year big-league career, with the knee requiring September surgery that casts some doubt upon his Opening Day availability.

Fulmer simply doesn't miss enough bats to install confidence in that level of a rebound, and his Detroit Tigers' rebuilding status also hurts him in terms of run and bullpen support.

Even if Peacock winds up back in the bullpen, he could still rack up 100 whiffs, which would give him value in formats where dominant relievers are valuable.

After ending last season as the Brewers' top pitcher, Chacin is assured a spot in the club's rotation for as long as he is healthy. He will be a free agent again after 2019, giving him extra motivation to continue pitching at a high level.

A series of setbacks eventually led to a decision to shut him down for good in September, at which point the injury was called a bone bruise. In November, Morrow had arthroscopic surgery on his right elbow, and while the procedure was referred to as a cleanup, he will not begin throwing until February at the earliest and is expected to miss at least the first month of the regular season. Morrow's strikeout and swinging-strike rate dropped last season as the Cubs reduced the use of his slider and cutter, perhaps in an effort to keep him healthy. His injury history likely limits him to a traditional closer role when he's able to pitch, as it's unlikely that he would be asked to get more than three outs on a regular basis. Pedro Strop is the favorite to open the season as the Cubs' closer in Morrow's absence.

A friendly home park and a solid track record keep Wacha interesting, but the injury risk and regression risk are both significant, limiting his appeal.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":28.0,"33":28.0,"34":468.0,"35":664.0,"36":0.0,"37":151.0,"38":0.255067568,"39":58.0,"40":3.0,"41":1.33974359,"42":3.0,"43":0.319277108,"44":77.0,"45":69.0,"46":17.0,"47":3.981450567,"48":140.0,"50":3.0,"51":1.0,"52":0.0,"53":10.0,"54":7.0,"55":0.588235294,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":1.0,"63":15.0,"64":1.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":2.413793103,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":79,"statCategoryRanking":142,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":0.3468736},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":0.82322127},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":0.25762388},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":1.0533882},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":300,"totalRating":2.2342737}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":32589,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":11,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":328,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,15,16,17],"firstName":"Hunter","fullName":"Hunter Strickland","id":32589,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"DAY_TO_DAY","jersey":"60","lastName":"Strickland","lastNewsDate":1552340594000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.5500945179584121,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":255.4907063197026,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":17.241149187493743,"percentStarted":12.779872534952785},"proTeamId":12,"seasonOutlook":"Strickland capitalized upon a Mark Melancon elbow injury coupled with Sam Dyson's awful Cactus League performance to grab the San Francisco Giants' closer job at the onset of the 2018 season, in which he was 13-of-16 converting saves with a 2.01 ERA in 33 appearances through the team's first 72 games on the schedule. In Game 73, however, he blew his fourth save in an ugly outing, then broke his right pinkie finger while punching a door in frustration, costing him a two-month absence. Strickland never showed quite the same command after his return, posting a 6.59 ERA and 1:1 K-to-walk ratio in 15 appearances, and the Giants moved on from him after the season. Now with the Seattle Mariners, he'll factor in their closer race during spring training, with his past experience probably granting him the edge.

Injury concerns help keep the hype down, as he hasn't thrown more than 110.2 innings since 2013, but he has real sleeper potential if his skills and health hold up this season.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":22.0,"33":22.0,"34":345.0,"35":485.0,"36":0.0,"37":100.0,"38":0.235294118,"39":47.0,"40":1.0,"41":1.278260869,"42":5.0,"43":0.313402062,"44":53.0,"45":49.0,"46":13.0,"47":3.811159042,"48":111.0,"50":10.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":7.0,"54":6.0,"55":0.538461538,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":13.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":2.361702128,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":74,"statCategoryRanking":132,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":0.70455515},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":0.41371387},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":0.7235522},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":0.8317786},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":282,"totalRating":2.4267664}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":31114,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":340,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Danny","fullName":"Danny Duffy","id":31114,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"DAY_TO_DAY","jersey":"41","lastName":"Duffy","lastNewsDate":1551819770000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.022727272727272728,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":260.1198761609907,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":3.866795559851995,"percentStarted":2.0034001133371113},"proTeamId":7,"seasonOutlook":"Shoulder issues limited Duffy to 28 starts last season and he didn't look anything like himself when available, finishing the year with a 4.88 ERA, the highest mark since his rookie campaign.

A 30-year-old pitcher with injury concerns and clear signs of decline is understandably one whose fantasy stock will fall quite far. He could at least be worth a flier if his price drops far enough, as he recorded a 3.47 ERA over the previous four seasons, and he pitches in a friendly home park.

The move to Tampa afforded Choi more chances than he was seeing in Milwaukee, and he responded in a big way, accumulating 21 extra-base hits over just 160 at-bats and posting an .876 OPS. That showing puts him in the driver's seat to earn an Opening Day roster spot for the second season in a row. Choi posted a woeful .513 OPS against southpaws last season, so assuming he breaks camp with the big club, he won't be an everyday player.

Now look closer: During that time he had a well-beneath-league-average .262 BABIP, a major league-high 90.8 left-on-base percentage and 4.1 home run/fly ball percentage that was second-lowest.

He'll be of use in deep-mixed and NL-only leagues, but is probably closer to a matchups option than one with good odds of a repeat.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":32.0,"33":32.0,"34":531.0,"35":737.0,"36":0.0,"37":171.0,"38":0.258698941,"39":57.0,"40":3.0,"41":1.288135593,"42":6.0,"43":0.317503392,"44":83.0,"45":76.0,"46":19.0,"47":3.852286109,"48":127.0,"50":5.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":10.0,"54":10.0,"55":0.5,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":1.0,"63":18.0,"64":1.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":2.228070175,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":30,"statCategoryRanking":42,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":1.1307344},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":1.6316384},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":1.1412811},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":2.3830457},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":96,"totalRating":6.0398664}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":31654,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":358,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Jake","fullName":"Jake Odorizzi","id":31654,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"12","lastName":"Odorizzi","lastNewsDate":1552326197000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.011363636363636364,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":260.2173374613003,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":3.848845346396081,"percentStarted":2.04272051717818},"proTeamId":9,"seasonOutlook":"Odorizzi, who was dealt from Tampa Bay to Minnesota prior to the 2018 campaign, was unspectacular in his first year with the Twins.

Odorizzi's struggles can largely be attributed to his inability to work through the order a third time. While he kept a tidy 3.04 ERA the first two times through the order last season, that number more than tripled (11.44 ERA) his third time through. Odorizzi has made at least 28 starts in five straight seasons and appears safe in the Twins' rotation, but his innings total could fall with better utilization.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":31.0,"33":31.0,"34":486.0,"35":690.0,"36":0.0,"37":152.0,"38":0.248772504,"39":63.0,"40":2.0,"41":1.327160494,"42":6.0,"43":0.320289855,"44":84.0,"45":80.0,"46":26.0,"47":4.439397329,"48":148.0,"50":1.0,"51":0.0,"52":1.0,"53":9.0,"54":9.0,"55":0.5,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":15.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":2.349206349,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":100,"statCategoryRanking":181,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.37534195},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.5468192},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":1.719675},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":0.8317786},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":377,"totalRating":1.382459}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":32690,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":361,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Chase","fullName":"Chase Anderson","id":32690,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"57","lastName":"Anderson","lastNewsDate":1551112039000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.011385199240986717,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":260.1064751764269,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":5.3808386411889595,"percentStarted":2.8960987261146496},"proTeamId":8,"seasonOutlook":"Anderson started Opening Day for the Brewers last season and pitched like an ace that day, but things went downhill after that as he rarely went deep into games and served up long balls left and right.

Things could have been even worse for him, as he finished 2018 with a FIP of 5.22. While he entered last season as the Brewers' top starter, he finished it out of the rotation, and off the playoff roster. Anderson signed a multi-year deal in 2017, so the Brewers will no doubt give him a chance to reclaim his place in the rotation during spring training.

While it's encouraging the issue wasn't arm related, DeSclafani suffered the same injury before the 2016 campaign. When on the hill, DeSclafani incurred a serious case of gopheritis, surrendering 24 homers in just 115 frames. His HR/FB ballooned to 19.8 percent, well above league average. While some regression is likely, DeSclafani needs to improve his location and sequencing, especially against left-handed batters. His velocity and K% ticked up a bit, though his swinging-strike rate remained the same. DeSclafani's 16.1 K-BB% last season plants a seed of optimism, but he needs to stay healthy and keep the ball in the yard.

Weaver might be more of a matchups candidate than one deep-mixed or NL-only managers can lock in.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":28.0,"33":28.0,"34":432.0,"35":621.0,"36":0.0,"37":151.0,"38":0.268683274,"39":53.0,"40":2.0,"41":1.416666667,"42":3.0,"43":0.333333333,"44":83.0,"45":74.0,"46":17.0,"47":4.595487979,"48":136.0,"50":3.0,"51":0.0,"52":1.0,"53":8.0,"54":8.0,"55":0.5,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":13.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":2.566037736,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":145,"statCategoryRanking":341,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":-1.4705337},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":-1.0809904},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":1.0609486},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":0.8317786},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":635,"totalRating":-0.9056303}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":31687,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":11,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":370,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,15,16,17],"firstName":"Jeurys","fullName":"Jeurys Familia","id":31687,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"27","lastName":"Familia","lastNewsDate":1544660358000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.07575757575757576,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":258.1503778025517,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":36.891820230677446,"percentStarted":33.42502982898051},"proTeamId":21,"seasonOutlook":"Familia topped 70 innings for the fourth time in five seasons in 2018, racking up 17 saves for the Mets before a midseason trade to Oakland. His strikeout rate jumped after the deal (11.5 K/9) and the A's altered his fastball mix by having him throw more four-seamers and fewer two-seamers, but his slider continues to generate most of his whiffs. After becoming a free agent for the first time in his career this offseason, Familia returned to the Mets on a three-year, $30 million deal. Interestingly enough, he chose to re-sign with his old club after they acquired Edwin Diaz from Seattle, which likely puts Familia in a setup role unless the Mets elect to mix and match their late-inning arms and forgo the use of a traditional closer. Without regular save opportunities, Familia doesn't miss enough bats or post ratios good enough to offer much value, outside of leagues that value holds.

The wear and tear accumulated over more than 11,000 MLB plate appearances has understandably taken its toll, and it wouldn't be surprising at all if the Angels opted to reduce his role even further in 2019. Justin Bour was added to serve as the primary first baseman, at least against right-handed pitching, and Ohtani should be cleared for DH duty for a good portion of the season. However, Ohtani is not expected to be ready for Opening Day while he rehabs his pitching elbow following Tommy John surgery, which could afford Pujols extra opportunities early on.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":290.0,"1":70.0,"2":0.24137931,"3":10.0,"4":0.0,"5":12.0,"6":22.0,"7":48.0,"8":116.0,"9":0.4,"10":18.0,"11":2.0,"12":1.0,"13":2.0,"14":2.0,"15":0.0,"16":311.0,"17":0.286173633,"18":0.686173633,"19":0.0,"20":29.0,"21":45.0,"22":0.0,"23":1.0,"24":0.0,"25":1.0,"26":8.0,"27":43.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":73.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":21,"statCategoryRanking":172,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.3065243},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":1.0609221},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":0.5332267},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":1.0784479},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.44554687}],"totalRanking":327,"totalRating":1.9205258}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":30937,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":374,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Michael","fullName":"Michael Pineda","id":30937,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"35","lastName":"Pineda","lastNewsDate":1551504553000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.05113636363636364,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":259.9702786377709,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":4.007219010059824,"percentStarted":1.5540924434343772},"proTeamId":9,"seasonOutlook":"Pineda's recovery from Tommy John surgery last season was interrupted by a subsequent surgery to repair a torn meniscus in his right knee, though all indications are that he should be fine for the start of 2019.

Whether he can get back to the form he showed in 2017 remains to be seen.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":20.0,"33":20.0,"34":327.0,"35":469.0,"36":0.0,"37":107.0,"38":0.256594724,"39":39.0,"40":1.0,"41":1.339449541,"42":8.0,"43":0.328358209,"44":56.0,"45":49.0,"46":12.0,"47":4.064938247,"48":104.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":1.0,"53":6.0,"54":6.0,"55":0.5,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":1.0,"63":11.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":2.666666667,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":0,"statCategoryRanking":0,"statRankings":[],"totalRanking":0,"totalRating":0.0}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":33829,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":381,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Zach","fullName":"Zach Davies","id":33829,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"27","lastName":"Davies","lastNewsDate":1552012647000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.003795066413662239,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":260.16891640866874,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":1.7765310892940627,"percentStarted":0.7713884992987378},"proTeamId":8,"seasonOutlook":"Davies was one of the Brewers' most dependable starters in 2016 and 2017, but due to injuries and manager Craig Counsell's decision not to re-insert him into the rotation late in the year, he made just 13 starts for the club in 2018. There were not any notable differences in Davies' profile a year ago, so there's reason to believe he will get back on track this year as long as he stays healthy. Davies has never averaged 90 mph with his fastball, but he mixes in a cutter, curveball and changeup well enough to keep opposing hitters off balance. Like his pitch mix, nothing about Davies' fantasy utility really stands out, but he did win 17 games two years ago, and if he can hold onto a rotation spot, he should be in position to rack up plenty of wins in 2019 for what is expected to be a quality Brewers squad.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":24.0,"33":24.0,"34":387.0,"35":546.0,"36":0.0,"37":136.0,"38":0.274747475,"39":36.0,"40":3.0,"41":1.333333333,"42":6.0,"43":0.326007326,"44":66.0,"45":62.0,"46":17.0,"47":4.349413295,"48":91.0,"50":1.0,"51":0.0,"52":1.0,"53":7.0,"54":7.0,"55":0.5,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":12.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":2.527777778,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":162,"statCategoryRanking":388,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.12543873},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.44953808},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.095839016},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.27626932},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":694,"totalRating":-1.1939185}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":31140,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":11,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":382,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,15,16,17],"firstName":"Wily","fullName":"Wily Peralta","id":31140,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"43","lastName":"Peralta","lastNewsDate":1550101908000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.026515151515151516,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":260.2460966542751,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":5.285566976017031,"percentStarted":3.6423510627681868},"proTeamId":7,"seasonOutlook":"Following the mid-June trade of Kelvin Herrera, and left with precious few candidates to fill his shoes, the Kansas City Royals moved Peralta into their closer role for the final three-fifths of the 2018 season. He rewarded them with a perfect 14-of-14 performance in the role, though it came with shaky control (15.4 percent walk rate), a few too many home runs and a scary-high hard contact rate (40.0 percent, says Statcast!), things that cast doubt upon his ability to repeat. While the Royals' bullpen isn't really any stronger entering 2019 than it was closing 2018, putting Peralta at the front of their saves race again, his skills rank among the riskiest -- and we'd argue the riskiest -- of any of the 30 projected closers. His high-90s fastball and slider combination should continue to result in a good strikeout rate, but everything else in his game is shaky, meaning that an investment in him is more about his role than raw ability.

Lesser relievers have been recycled back to closing, but Boxberger will need to do something about his career 13.6 percent walk rate if he wants to hang onto the job.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":59.0,"33":0.0,"34":162.0,"35":237.0,"36":0.0,"37":44.0,"38":0.218905473,"39":30.0,"40":4.0,"41":1.37037037,"42":2.0,"43":0.320675105,"44":27.0,"45":25.0,"46":7.0,"47":4.175457358,"48":66.0,"50":4.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":1.0,"54":5.0,"55":0.166666667,"56":31.0,"57":27.0,"58":4.0,"59":0.870967742,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":2.2,"83":27.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":25,"statCategoryRanking":72,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.40755028},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.14584595},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":0.25762388},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.054659735},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":4.4898267}],"totalRanking":171,"totalRating":4.1393948}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":29166,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":388,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Jeff","fullName":"Jeff Samardzija","id":29166,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"29","lastName":"Samardzija","lastNewsDate":1551776851000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.017077798861480076,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":259.8646439628483,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":2.503834100153364,"percentStarted":0.9468560378742416},"proTeamId":26,"seasonOutlook":"A shoulder injury sabotaged Samardzija's 2018 season. He had a pectoral injury in spring training but the shoulder problem was first disclosed publicly in late May when Samardzija landed on the injured list. The right-hander was activated July 7, but was back on the shelf again before the All-Star break, having been knocked around in a pair of starts. Renewed soreness ended his season for good in August. The issue was not addressed surgically in the offseason, as both Samardzija and the Giants decided rest and rehab should do the trick. Samardzija had posted a career-low 3.8% walk rate in 2017, leading to a healthy 20.4 K-BB% that year, which was a top-15 mark among qualified starters. However, Samardzija does not bring high-end dominance to the table, and the argument can be made that he got too much of the plate that year. He has looked healthy this spring, so he is very much a bargain-bin consideration, even if we can't expect the ERA to line up with the estimators.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":20.0,"33":20.0,"34":318.0,"35":445.0,"36":0.0,"37":106.0,"38":0.261083744,"39":30.0,"40":1.0,"41":1.283018868,"42":3.0,"43":0.312359551,"44":55.0,"45":53.0,"46":15.0,"47":4.476176359,"48":91.0,"50":2.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":5.0,"54":7.0,"55":0.416666667,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":10.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":3.033333333,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":262,"statCategoryRanking":696,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.9350779},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":-1.0406996},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.40110242},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.4978789},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":1130,"totalRating":-3.1215923}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":30517,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":11,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":392,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,15,16,17],"firstName":"Blake","fullName":"Blake Parker","id":30517,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"38","lastName":"Parker","lastNewsDate":1546871577000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.02462121212121212,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":260.27041764778784,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":3.2735022811282426,"percentStarted":2.4776049818508774},"proTeamId":9,"seasonOutlook":"Parker seemed to lose his closer's job before he even got his feet wet in it last season, and as the year progressed, he looked like an entirely different pitcher than the one who finished 2017 on a high note and staked his claim to the ninth inning in L.A.

Lugo's curveball was always intriguing due to its very high spin rate, but he'd been unable to translate that into a high strikeout rate in his first two big-league seasons. Last year, that number jumped up to 25.1%.

Still, with an Opening Day rotation spot virtually assured, LeBlanc is in play in AL-only formats as well as a consideration in mixed leagues where he can be deployed mainly at home in pitcher-friendly T-Mobile Park.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":30.0,"33":30.0,"34":495.0,"35":676.0,"36":0.0,"37":159.0,"38":0.253184713,"39":41.0,"40":1.0,"41":1.212121212,"42":3.0,"43":0.300295858,"44":81.0,"45":73.0,"46":23.0,"47":3.959951958,"48":130.0,"50":1.0,"51":0.0,"52":1.0,"53":10.0,"54":8.0,"55":0.555555556,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":16.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":3.170731707,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":52,"statCategoryRanking":78,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":1.0738107},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":0.6328953},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":1.2055471},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":1.2749978},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":186,"totalRating":3.9404178}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":32029,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":11,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":409,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,15,16,17],"firstName":"Kelvin","fullName":"Kelvin Herrera","id":32029,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"41","lastName":"Herrera","lastNewsDate":1551984028000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.1342155009451796,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":259.3708798017348,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":11.401850562133122,"percentStarted":6.961164726561204},"proTeamId":4,"seasonOutlook":"The Royals used Herrera as their closer to begin the season, and he pitched very well in that role, carrying a 1.05 ERA, 0.82 WHIP and an impressive 22 K's and just two walks in 25 2/3 innings before he was flipped to the Nationals in June. Although he had a brief opportunity to close in Washington when Sean Doolittle was on the DL, a shoulder injury sent Herrera to the shelf in early August before a season-ending foot injury shut him down for good later that month. A first-time free agent during the offseason, Herrera signed a two-year deal with the White Sox in January. He's expected to compete with Alex Colome for save chances. Herrera had surgery to repair a torn ligament in his foot in September, but he should arrive to spring training in February without restrictions assuming everything has gone as planned with his rehab.

The odds of him returning to a starting role after such a long layoff can't be high, and the Indians will probably be happy to take whatever they can get from him. With a hard fastball and slider powering a 33.0% strikeout rate the last time Salazar was on the mound, he could certainly be a weapon as a late-inning reliever.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":31.0,"33":0.0,"34":132.0,"35":187.0,"36":0.0,"37":40.0,"38":0.242424242,"39":20.0,"40":0.0,"41":1.363636363,"42":1.0,"43":0.326203209,"44":22.0,"45":20.0,"46":5.0,"47":4.021830572,"48":56.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":3.0,"54":2.0,"55":0.6,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":2.8,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":0,"statCategoryRanking":0,"statRankings":[],"totalRanking":0,"totalRating":0.0}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":33223,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":421,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Julio","fullName":"Julio Urias","id":33223,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"7","lastName":"Urias","lastNewsDate":1551980880000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.18216318785578747,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":258.22167182662537,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":8.99111865083325,"percentStarted":3.658982802780827},"proTeamId":19,"seasonOutlook":"Urias' recovery from June 2017 anterior capsule surgery on his left shoulder, an operation initially projected to cost him 12-14 months and one that risked adversely impacting his career, couldn't have gone much smoother than it did last season.

There was some caution an extreme groundball pitcher would be unable to maintain the .269 BABIP he posted that season, but still, Sanchez was viewed as a rising fantasy star. However, blisters harpooned his 2017 effort and a bruised finger limited Sanchez to 20 starts last year. They injury occurred after he got his right index finger stuck in a suitcase, ultimately requiring surgery to repair UCL damage. Pre-injury, Sanchez was sporting a 4.35 ERA with a lofty 1.49 WHIP, spurred by 44 walks in 78.2 frames. Perhaps to avoid blister issues, Sanchez threw significantly fewer sinkers, increasing the use of his less effective curveball and changeup. Curiously, Sanchez's swinging strike rate increased last season, but his strikeout rate dropped. Entering 2019, Sanchez is a wild card. Aside from health, he needs to display his 2016 form, especially in the control department, to be worth any sort of investment.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":22.0,"33":22.0,"34":348.0,"35":509.0,"36":0.0,"37":114.0,"38":0.256179775,"39":55.0,"40":1.0,"41":1.456896552,"42":6.0,"43":0.343811395,"44":60.0,"45":56.0,"46":12.0,"47":4.334927091,"48":92.0,"50":4.0,"51":0.0,"52":1.0,"53":6.0,"54":7.0,"55":0.461538462,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":11.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":1.672727273,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":209,"statCategoryRanking":527,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":-1.5791177},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.7980049},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":0.4986213},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":0.16694985},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":872,"totalRating":-1.9583848}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":36081,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":425,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Caleb","fullName":"Caleb Smith","id":36081,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"31","lastName":"Smith","lastNewsDate":1552161818000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0056925996204933585,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":260.1560371517028,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":1.149924786896206,"percentStarted":0.3275948520808959},"proTeamId":28,"seasonOutlook":"Smith was penning one of 2018's most unexpectedly compelling breakthrough stories, posting a 4.19 ERA and 27.0 percent strikeout rate through 16 starts, before a lat issue sidelined him and ultimately required season-ending surgery in July.

He has been a slightly-better-than-average starter in real life in each of the last three seasons, with his FIP ranging from 3.83 to 4.14 in that time. His success stems largely from being stingy with free passes (4.3 percent walk rate in 2018) and keeping the ball on the ground. His ground ball rate fell five percentage points last season, but it was still above average at 48.7 percent. Leake threw his changeup more than ever in 2018 and ended up with the best chase rate of his career, but that didn't translate to more strikeouts, as his 15.2 percent strikeout rate was his lowest since 2013. Leake has significantly more appeal in points leagues and AL-only formats where volume and stability are emphasized to a greater degree.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":31.0,"33":31.0,"34":555.0,"35":782.0,"36":0.0,"37":205.0,"38":0.279672578,"39":35.0,"40":3.0,"41":1.297297297,"42":7.0,"43":0.315856777,"44":95.0,"45":89.0,"46":21.0,"47":4.327821862,"48":124.0,"50":2.0,"51":0.0,"52":2.0,"53":10.0,"54":11.0,"55":0.476190476,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":16.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":3.542857143,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":88,"statCategoryRanking":154,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":0.040898304},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.38389915},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":1.0288156},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":1.4966074},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":325,"totalRating":1.9355888}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":31593,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":429,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Tanner","fullName":"Tanner Roark","id":31593,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"35","lastName":"Roark","lastNewsDate":1550872576000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.14800759013282733,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":258.46736842105264,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":10.372093023255815,"percentStarted":5.93687707641196},"proTeamId":17,"seasonOutlook":"Roark is primarily an innings eater at stage of his career, but he still represented a significant upgrade for the Reds -- his 4.34 ERA last season was better than their staff's 4.65 mark.

Will Smith figures to open the year as the Giants' closer, but Melancon is still owed $28 million over the next two seasons, so he'll likely hang around the end-of-game conversation and could step into the ninth-inning role should Smith get hurt or dealt to a contender.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":45.0,"33":0.0,"34":129.0,"35":182.0,"36":0.0,"37":45.0,"38":0.266272189,"39":12.0,"40":1.0,"41":1.325581395,"42":1.0,"43":0.318681319,"44":18.0,"45":16.0,"46":3.0,"47":3.388198323,"48":37.0,"50":4.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":1.0,"54":4.0,"55":0.2,"56":10.0,"57":7.0,"58":3.0,"59":0.7,"60":11.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":3.083333333,"83":18.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":203,"statCategoryRanking":352,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.7127548},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":0.3935264},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.38503593},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.4978789},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":0.19722855}],"totalRanking":648,"totalRating":-1.0049146}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":33107,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":451,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Jose","fullName":"Jose Urena","id":33107,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"62","lastName":"Urena","lastNewsDate":1550155885000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.011385199240986717,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":259.7876160990712,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":4.204674079499301,"percentStarted":2.1739130434782608},"proTeamId":28,"seasonOutlook":"Urena has quietly put together two strong seasons for the Marlins, and in 2018 the peripherals were more supportive of the results.

Given the Angels' underwhelming rotation depth, Barria should get a chance to build on his 2018 success.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":28.0,"33":28.0,"34":417.0,"35":578.0,"36":0.0,"37":129.0,"38":0.24665392,"39":45.0,"40":0.0,"41":1.251798561,"42":5.0,"43":0.309688581,"44":65.0,"45":61.0,"46":18.0,"47":3.925291991,"48":110.0,"50":4.0,"51":1.0,"52":1.0,"53":8.0,"54":7.0,"55":0.533333333,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":16.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":2.444444444,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":66,"statCategoryRanking":110,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":0.24805795},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":0.92382413},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":0.69141924},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":1.4966074},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":237,"totalRating":3.1130753}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":31094,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":461,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Wade","fullName":"Wade Miley","id":31094,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"20","lastName":"Miley","lastNewsDate":1552272210000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.01890359168241966,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":259.94564813668444,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":4.054098959891005,"percentStarted":2.186555012793673},"proTeamId":18,"seasonOutlook":"Few would have expected Miley to be a top-two starter on a team that reached the NLCS last season, but that's precisely what happened, as Miley came out of nowhere to have his best season since 2015. Miley earned a spot in the rotation during spring training, but an oblique injury delayed the start of his season until May. Once Miley made his debut, he made 16 starts for the Brewers and did not allow more than three earned runs in any of them. The key to Miley's success last year was not added velocity -- his average fastball was right in line with his career average -- but rather a new pitch mix that saw him feature his cutter and offspeed stuff. Despite the big 2018 campaign, Miley earned only a one-year contract from the Astros during the offseason. His pitch mix sets him up for more success, and his new team will certainly help in his quest to pick up wins. However, some regression should be factored in, as Miley's FIP (3.59) was more than a run higher than the ERA he finished with in 2018.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":20.0,"33":20.0,"34":306.0,"35":440.0,"36":0.0,"37":104.0,"38":0.265984655,"39":39.0,"40":1.0,"41":1.401960784,"42":5.0,"43":0.336363636,"44":51.0,"45":49.0,"46":12.0,"47":4.297832953,"48":83.0,"50":2.0,"51":0.0,"52":1.0,"53":6.0,"54":5.0,"55":0.545454545,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":10.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":2.128205128,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":91,"statCategoryRanking":161,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":0.42200446},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":1.3292445},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.07977252},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":0.38855943},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":340,"totalRating":1.8132026}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":33838,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":465,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Brent","fullName":"Brent Honeywell","id":33838,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"DAY_TO_DAY","jersey":"59","lastName":"Honeywell","lastNewsDate":1552169193000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.041666666666666664,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":260.1181424148607,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":2.374343711333311,"percentStarted":0.5885697087248771},"proTeamId":30,"seasonOutlook":"Last spring, Honeywell was one of the top pitching prospects in the game with a chance to make his MLB debut during the 2018 season. However, he hurt his elbow in February, requiring the dreaded Tommy John surgery. His recovery has gone as planned, and the expectation is Honeywell throws his first pitch in the bigs sometime in June. As is the case with all TJS recoverees, it's a wait-and-see situation, especially since Honeywell's bread and butter is the little used screwball. While the long-term plan for Honeywell is to start, Tampa could opt to deploy him as a reliever behind their crew of openers. Considering Honeywell is probably better served staying on a consistent warm-up routine, though, he may start but have his workload tempered with shorter outings. If this is the case, his potential to rack up wins takes a major hit. The bottom line is, until he shows otherwise, Honeywell should still be considered as one of the top pitching prospects in the game. Temper expectations for this season, however.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":17.0,"33":0.0,"34":165.0,"35":226.0,"36":0.0,"37":53.0,"38":0.252380952,"39":17.0,"40":0.0,"41":1.272727272,"42":1.0,"43":0.314159292,"44":25.0,"45":23.0,"46":6.0,"47":3.750295543,"48":55.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":3.0,"54":3.0,"55":0.5,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":3.235294118,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":0,"statCategoryRanking":0,"statRankings":[],"totalRanking":0,"totalRating":0.0}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":30361,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":11,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":466,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,15,16,17],"firstName":"Craig","fullName":"Craig Stammen","id":30361,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"34","lastName":"Stammen","lastNewsDate":1536035321000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.009487666034155597,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":260.13434130623375,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":1.6992239764516992,"percentStarted":1.2978324859512977},"proTeamId":25,"seasonOutlook":"At the age of 34 last season, Stammen set a new professional best with a 27.8 percent strikeout rate, helping him to a 2.73 ERA and 23 holds.

Chirinos relies on control with a ground ball tilt, though he possesses some projectable strikeout upside.

Chirinos may not amass the innings of a typical starter, but he should throw significantly more than most relievers for those leagues designating starter and reliever roster spots.

Yarbrough could again be a handy \"gadget\" player if the Rays continue their role-driven pitching strategy, but he's a dangerous investment in shallow or weekly-transaction leagues.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":30.0,"33":0.0,"34":453.0,"35":632.0,"36":0.0,"37":146.0,"38":0.253472222,"39":48.0,"40":4.0,"41":1.284768212,"42":7.0,"43":0.318037975,"44":72.0,"45":66.0,"46":19.0,"47":3.91812062,"48":127.0,"50":1.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":9.0,"54":8.0,"55":0.529411765,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":2.645833333,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":24,"statCategoryRanking":69,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":0.10211436},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":0.32145175},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":1.1734141},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":2.8262649},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":168,"totalRating":4.1764116}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":30400,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":471,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Ivan","fullName":"Ivan Nova","id":30400,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"46","lastName":"Nova","lastNewsDate":1552387207000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.003787878787878788,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":260.07206537890045,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":2.228152101400934,"percentStarted":1.2141427618412275},"proTeamId":4,"seasonOutlook":"If you're digging around in the bargain bin for a starting pitcher and considering Nova, know this: He has posted an ERA over 5.00 on the road in each of the past three seasons and no longer has the park advantage following an offseason trade to the White Sox.

Guaranteed Rate Field in Chicago played more neutral last season, but it's still a significant downgrade for Nova. He regularly ranks among the league leaders in walk rate, but Nova's strikeout rate sat at 16.7 percent the last two seasons -- well below average -- and all that contact leaves a lot up to chance from start to start.

Harvey's velocity will likely never consistently be what it was in his younger years, but with the Reds, he was still sitting in the mid-90s with his fastball, maxing out a couple ticks higher.

job.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":40.0,"33":0.0,"34":117.0,"35":166.0,"36":0.0,"37":33.0,"38":0.226027397,"39":16.0,"40":1.0,"41":1.256410256,"42":3.0,"43":0.313253012,"44":14.0,"45":13.0,"46":5.0,"47":3.105154525,"48":43.0,"50":2.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":1.0,"54":3.0,"55":0.25,"56":4.0,"57":2.0,"58":2.0,"59":0.5,"60":9.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":2.6875,"83":11.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":150,"statCategoryRanking":275,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.25336492},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":0.38493755},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.36896944},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.27626932},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":0.4932698}],"totalRanking":530,"totalRating":-0.020396288}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":34862,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":11,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":481,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,15,16,17,14],"firstName":"Matt","fullName":"Matt

willingness and success in the opener role helped it gain traction. With the Rays announcing they intend to continue using openers twice in the course of five games, Stanek has a solid chance to top last season's 29 starts, with the downside he will be ineligible for logging wins. A .253 BABIP fueled much of last season's prosperity; a level Stanek will be hard pressed to repeat, especially if he's matched up against the opposition's first three batters. Stanek features a 98-mph fastball along with a slider and splitter he mixes in on occasion. Without a quality off-speed pitch, Stanek is ideally suited for opener duties, as he's only going to work an inning, maybe two per outing. Still, even if Stanek's BABIP regression doesn't hurt his ratios significantly, the inability to vulture a win limits his fantasy potential.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":1.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":40.0,"33":40.0,"34":165.0,"35":224.0,"36":198.0,"37":44.0,"38":0.222222222,"39":25.0,"41":1.254545455,"42":1.0,"43":0.3125,"44":23.0,"45":21.0,"46":7.0,"47":3.436363636,"50":3.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":4.0,"54":2.0,"55":0.666666667,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":2.6,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":98,"statCategoryRanking":171,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":0.8787318},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":0.81791675},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":0.41828883},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.27626932},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":361,"totalRating":1.5918349}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":32151,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":485,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Tyler","fullName":"Tyler Anderson","id":32151,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"44","lastName":"Anderson","lastNewsDate":1547202762000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0018975332068311196,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":260.1306501547988,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":3.090140188471912,"percentStarted":1.7814924577936133},"proTeamId":27,"seasonOutlook":"Anderson could be a moderately interesting fantasy option if he pitched for a different team.

At Coors Field, however, being a touch better than average translates to a 4.55 ERA, making him a rather unappealing candidate. His respectable skill set should theoretically make him a good streaming option, playable in weeks where he only starts in easier parks, but he's oddly had a lower ERA at home than on the road in each of his three seasons. Pitches do move differently in the thin Colorado air, so it's possible that he's gotten used to pitching at home, but it's easy to see that trend reversing this season, especially as his ground ball rate has decreased for three straight seasons.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":31.0,"33":31.0,"34":519.0,"35":725.0,"36":0.0,"37":173.0,"38":0.264122137,"39":56.0,"40":1.0,"41":1.323699422,"42":3.0,"43":0.32,"44":95.0,"45":88.0,"46":25.0,"47":4.589344584,"48":156.0,"50":10.0,"51":3.0,"52":5.0,"53":8.0,"54":11.0,"55":0.421052632,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":15.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":2.785714286,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":87,"statCategoryRanking":153,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":0.27460358},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.6754814},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":1.7518079},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":0.8317786},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":324,"totalRating":1.9358754}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":35096,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":487,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Daniel","fullName":"Daniel Mengden","id":35096,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"33","lastName":"Mengden","lastNewsDate":1551896573000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.001893939393939394,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":260.16431401684,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":1.1306238501421642,"percentStarted":0.5318615153035625},"proTeamId":11,"seasonOutlook":"Mengden is slotted for the back end of the rotation in Oakland, but is really just the placeholder for Jesus Luzardo.

While his rotisserie numbers didn't reflect his success, his 2.67 FIP shows that he pitched rather effectively, as his 57.3 left-on-base percentage played a big part in his 4.38 ERA. Fry's platoon splits are balanced enough that he should continue in a late-inning role, though it'll have to be in a setup capacity after the team added Alex Colome and Kelvin Herrera during the winter. Fry should be a good source of ERA, K's and holds, though.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":72.0,"33":0.0,"34":165.0,"35":229.0,"36":0.0,"37":43.0,"38":0.209756098,"39":21.0,"40":0.0,"41":1.163636363,"42":1.0,"43":0.283842795,"44":25.0,"45":23.0,"46":5.0,"47":3.681835367,"48":69.0,"50":5.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":2.0,"54":4.0,"55":0.333333333,"56":5.0,"57":2.0,"58":3.0,"59":0.4,"60":15.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":3.285714286,"83":17.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":109,"statCategoryRanking":219,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":0.6148308},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.13832319},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":0.24155739},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.27626932},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":0.34524918}],"totalRanking":444,"totalRating":0.7870448}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":30089,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":11,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":497,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,15,16,17],"firstName":"Hector","fullName":"Hector Rondon","id":30089,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"30","lastName":"Rondon","lastNewsDate":1551211072000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.007575757575757576,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":260.1182302639732,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":1.8440709617180207,"percentStarted":1.4705882352941178},"proTeamId":18,"seasonOutlook":"Rondon seems to own the skills of a closer, but his year-over-year inconsistency has made him frustrating to roster.

The lefty is primarily a fastball/curve guy who hides the ball rather well but needs an off-speed pitch if he is to remain in the starting mix.

As usual, the sidewinding righty was more effective against same-side hitters, holding righty swingers to a .551 OPS, compared to a .900 mark versus lefties. With his low strikeout rate and innings, Neshek needs saves -- or holds in leagues using them -- to be fantasy-useful. He logged five saves and six holds last season.

pick.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":63.0,"33":0.0,"34":192.0,"35":259.0,"36":0.0,"37":54.0,"38":0.229787234,"39":19.0,"40":2.0,"41":1.140625,"42":3.0,"43":0.293436293,"44":24.0,"45":22.0,"46":8.0,"47":3.150083702,"48":63.0,"50":3.0,"51":1.0,"52":0.0,"53":3.0,"54":4.0,"55":0.428571429,"56":3.0,"57":0.0,"58":3.0,"59":0.0,"60":16.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":3.315789474,"83":16.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":54,"statCategoryRanking":125,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":1.2471048},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":1.1036242},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":0.16122492},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":0.38855943},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":271,"totalRating":2.6536798}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":32566,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":11,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":517,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,15,16,17],"firstName":"Will","fullName":"Will

was shifted to relief early last season by the Miami Marlins, and the result was considerably greater average fastball velocity (95.3 mph) and a spike in strikeout rate (24.8 percent, his highest since he was a Class A ball starter). Unfortunately, that merely made him a productive reliever rather than one of the game's new elite, and most of his fantasy value is tied to the fact that he's on a rebuilding Marlins team that might go with a committee approach to saves. Conley's ERA and WHIP probably won't be good enough to warrant using him to support those categories, so monitor how the team's closer race settles this

was a bit ahead of his time, morphing into a multi-inning, high-leverage reliever a few years back with the Giants. We see pitchers in the same mold more and more now, including Seth Lugo, Jesse Chavez, and of course, Josh Hader. Petit has lost some effectiveness in recent seasons and isn't as good as any of those aforementioned arms, but he is likely penciled in for close to 90 innings out of Oakland's bullpen and will serve in a flexible role. Petit is more of a flyball pitcher (career 33.8 GB%), which keeps his WHIP low, but it's a double-edged sword as he's also dealt with some home-run issues. He remains stingy with the free passes but the K-rate sunk back to 20.7% last season, saddling Petit with a FIP almost a full run higher than his ERA. In AL-only leagues, Petit still has some value, but that's about the extent of his appeal. In mixed leagues, even those that count saves-plus-holds, there should be better options.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":63.0,"33":0.0,"34":264.0,"35":350.0,"36":0.0,"37":78.0,"38":0.23853211,"39":18.0,"40":4.0,"41":1.090909091,"42":0.0,"43":0.274285714,"44":35.0,"45":33.0,"46":13.0,"47":3.382474616,"48":77.0,"50":1.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":3.0,"54":7.0,"55":0.3,"56":2.0,"57":0.0,"58":2.0,"59":0.0,"60":14.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":4.277777778,"83":14.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":39,"statCategoryRanking":95,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":1.5958585},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":1.0904149},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":0.33795637},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":0.8317786},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":208,"totalRating":3.609175}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":32048,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":524,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Wei-Yin","fullName":"Wei-Yin Chen","id":32048,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"54","lastName":"Chen","lastNewsDate":1537996807000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":259.9117027863777,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":0.6754497425265833,"percentStarted":0.33103725005015716},"proTeamId":28,"seasonOutlook":"Chen hasn't met expectations since signing with Miami in January 2016, with poor health hindering his overall effectiveness.

Those splits are worth remembering when considering Chen in DFS or as a season-long streamer.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":22.0,"33":22.0,"34":348.0,"35":493.0,"36":0.0,"37":114.0,"38":0.255605381,"39":38.0,"40":4.0,"41":1.310344827,"42":1.0,"43":0.310344828,"44":62.0,"45":59.0,"46":16.0,"47":4.541675003,"48":95.0,"50":4.0,"51":1.0,"52":0.0,"53":6.0,"54":7.0,"55":0.461538462,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":11.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":2.5,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":121,"statCategoryRanking":261,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24367833},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.8546147},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":0.9002837},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":0.610169},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":509,"totalRating":0.16532645}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":36035,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":11,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":527,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,15,16,17],"firstName":"Jonathan","fullName":"Jonathan Holder","id":36035,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"56","lastName":"Holder","lastNewsDate":1537788212000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.003787878787878788,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":259.91498326930224,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":0.3689541825987791,"percentStarted":0.231434896357416},"proTeamId":10,"stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":62.0,"33":0.0,"34":201.0,"35":274.0,"36":0.0,"37":56.0,"38":0.22310757,"39":18.0,"40":2.0,"41":1.104477612,"42":2.0,"43":0.277372263,"44":25.0,"45":23.0,"46":9.0,"47":3.096728889,"48":69.0,"50":1.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":5.0,"54":2.0,"55":0.714285714,"56":1.0,"57":0.0,"58":1.0,"59":0.0,"60":4.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":3.833333333,"83":4.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":106,"statCategoryRanking":215,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":0.8526133},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":0.70714563},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":0.080892436},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.4978789},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":435,"totalRating":0.8959391}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":32058,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":529,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Matt","fullName":"Matt Shoemaker","id":32058,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"52","lastName":"Shoemaker","lastNewsDate":1552235346000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.00946969696969697,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":259.98625386996906,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":1.4764338444065872,"percentStarted":0.7983431873601229},"proTeamId":14,"seasonOutlook":"Forearm issues limited Shoemaker to just seven starts last season, and his results were uninspiring, as he finished with a 4.94 ERA.

He managed to record 18 holds with seven saves, despite pitching significantly worse than in his freshman campaign. The sidewinding right-hander's K-rate dropped four points to 21.9 percent, while his BB-rate more than doubled to 8.2 percent. That said, torpedoed by a low 66.1 percent LOB-rate, Hildenberger's 3.80 xFIP and 3.73 SIERA make the argument that his actual 5.42 ERA was out of sync with his true skill level. Hildenberger doesn't exhibit the usual split disparity characteristic of a sidearm delivery, boding well for his chances of continuing to see high-leverage work.

He was tougher to hit last season, as opponents saw their average against him drop 33 points year over year, but the groundballer still allowed nearly a hit per inning pitched. He did garner 13 saves last year in what was a shallower bullpen, but it would take a series of unfortunate events for him to get a crack at that many saves once again in 2019. Then again, these are the Mets we are talking about, so anything is possible. Gsellman does not have another level to his game as his stuff is mostly designed to initiate weak contact rather than try to blow pitches by hitters.

following a midseason trade to the Cubs. Now back with the Rangers, he'll hope to be a stabilizing force on a staff full of unproven arms. Jose Leclerc will presumably open as the team's closer, but Chavez could be the next man up should Leclerc struggle or get injured. Most will probably just want to wait and see if that happens instead of rostering Chavez on draft day, as his 24.4 percent strikeout rate is not strong enough to make him a budget Josh Hader despite a similarly heavy workload.

Norris' 27 percent strikeout rate as a reliever is worthy of high-leverage duties. However, inconsistent control and home run woes are a concern. Over the past two seasons, 12 of Norris' 19 homers allowed have come after the break, despite throwing almost 30 fewer innings in that span. Norris' xFIP the past two seasons has been 3.65 and 3.66, with even better 3.60 and 3.30 SIERA marks, emphasizing his need to keep the ball in the yard.

Despite moving to a more pitcher-friendly park, Rodney's numbers took a step back across the board with the A's, though the 41-year-old still finished the season with a combined 3.36 ERA and 9.8 K/9 in 64.1 innings between the two stops. Unsurprisingly, Rodney posted a BB/9 north of 4.1 for the fourth straight season, resulting in a bloated 1.46 WHIP. He notched seven holds with Oakland and figures to reprise his role as one of team's top setup men in 2019.

He's a good dynasty/keeper pick but a risky bet for WHIP in redraft formats.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":28.0,"33":28.0,"34":453.0,"35":631.0,"36":0.0,"37":131.0,"38":0.237749546,"39":71.0,"40":2.0,"41":1.337748344,"42":9.0,"43":0.334389857,"44":68.0,"45":63.0,"46":12.0,"47":3.743834666,"48":147.0,"50":9.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":9.0,"54":8.0,"55":0.529411765,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":16.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":2.070422535,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":146,"statCategoryRanking":345,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.07968294},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":0.03353095},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.36896944},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.27626932},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":639,"totalRating":-0.9382241}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":35241,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":584,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Sandy","fullName":"Sandy Alcantara","id":35241,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"22","lastName":"Alcantara","lastNewsDate":1551888925000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.003795066413662239,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":259.9190193164933,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":2.001000500250125,"percentStarted":0.9938302484575621},"proTeamId":28,"seasonOutlook":"Alcantara made six starts for the Miami Marlins, three of them strong quality-start efforts during a September rotation audition, but the final tally had him with a bloated 15.8 percent walk rate.

As a flyball pitcher, even in cavernous Tropicana Field, Faria is going to surrender homers. In order to mitigate damage and frequency, he needs to improve control while figuring out a way to miss more bats. A 92-mph fastball isn't going to get it done with today's quality of major league hitter, so Faria needs to improve command and control of his secondary pitches. Scouts graded Faria's changeup a plus pitch, and his slider has been his most effective offering in the majors, so he has the arsenal to improve. However, until he displays the ability to maneuver his way through a lineup more than once, at best Faria will fill in as an opener, resulting in limited fantasy utility, even in deep formats.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":18.0,"33":18.0,"34":264.0,"35":370.0,"36":0.0,"37":78.0,"38":0.240740741,"39":42.0,"40":1.0,"41":1.363636363,"42":3.0,"43":0.332432432,"44":44.0,"45":42.0,"46":12.0,"47":4.304522397,"48":80.0,"50":2.0,"51":0.0,"52":1.0,"53":5.0,"54":5.0,"55":0.5,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":9.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":1.904761905,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":178,"statCategoryRanking":443,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.51141053},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.88065577},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.07977252},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":0.16694985},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":771,"totalRating":-1.5517223}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":39671,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":586,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Pablo","fullName":"Pablo Lopez","id":39671,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"49","lastName":"Lopez","lastNewsDate":1552233973000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.0056925996204933585,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":259.96755417956655,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":0.7666298416524389,"percentStarted":0.20421144253623916},"proTeamId":28,"seasonOutlook":"Lopez finished 2018 in High-A but shot all the way to the majors last season, making 10 starts and posting a respectable 4.14 ERA.

some circles, the prospect shine on Sheffield has dimmed a bit, suggesting he's best suited for late inning relief work, though Seattle likely disagrees. He's just 22 years old, but Sheffield was in the Yankees' system since 2016. Obviously, things can change, but his secondaries and control have not come along as rapidly as his fastball and slider. The Mariners didn't deal James Paxton for someone they expect to be a reliever, so Sheffield should be given every chance to make it as a starter. T-Mobile Park provides Sheffield more home run protection than Yankee Stadium, though potential run support obviously pales in comparison. Sheffield may not break camp with the club, but there's a good chance he debuts for Seattle this season. He is at minimum worth monitoring, and could be worth stashing in leagues with numerous reserve spots.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":12.0,"33":12.0,"34":183.0,"35":255.0,"36":0.0,"37":54.0,"38":0.238938053,"39":28.0,"40":0.0,"41":1.344262295,"42":1.0,"43":0.325490196,"44":27.0,"45":25.0,"46":6.0,"47":3.673360937,"48":55.0,"50":2.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":4.0,"54":3.0,"55":0.571428571,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":7.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":1.964285714,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":235,"statCategoryRanking":594,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.23694804},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.18794033},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.8830973},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.7194885},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":962,"totalRating":-2.2743075}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":31086,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":593,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Alex","fullName":"Alex Cobb","id":31086,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","jersey":"17","lastName":"Cobb","lastNewsDate":1552175064000,"ownership":{"activityLevel":null,"auctionValueAverage":0.003787878787878788,"auctionValueAverageChange":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":259.9912074303406,"averageDraftPositionPercentChange":0.0,"date":1552398990538,"leagueType":0,"percentChange":0.0,"percentOwned":1.435917985707607,"percentStarted":0.7346557136178454},"proTeamId":1,"seasonOutlook":"It is unfortunate that most feel that Tommy John surgery is so automatic that pitchers \"come back throwing better than ever\" after the surgery. Cobb is certainly wondering when that will happen for him. Pre-surgery, Cobb was dealing with a sinking fastball, a sharp curve and a deadly \"splangeup\" that he would throw any time in the count. Post-surgery Cobb has been over-reliant on his fastball almost as if he is afraid to throw the splangeup. The pitch simply lacked its normal shape early on last year, but got progressively better as the season wore on as the whiff rate on the pitch improved month after month. The formula for owning Cobb is simple: watch the splitter. If the pitch is not there, you can quickly cut bait and move onto another solution from the free-agent pile. Without the splitter, he cannot return any type of fantasy value.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":30.0,"33":30.0,"34":489.0,"35":698.0,"36":0.0,"37":180.0,"38":0.279937792,"39":45.0,"40":4.0,"41":1.380368098,"42":5.0,"43":0.329512894,"44":93.0,"45":85.0,"46":24.0,"47":4.703087073,"48":110.0,"50":5.0,"51":1.0,"52":2.0,"53":8.0,"54":10.0,"55":0.444444444,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":1.0,"63":14.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":2.444444444,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":159,"statCategoryRanking":375,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.90520775},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":-1.1145387},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":0.7556852},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":0.38855943},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":677,"totalRating":-1.122335}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":36157,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":594,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Dinelson","fullName":"Dinelson

one of the more promising young arms in the Nationals organization, Ross' future as a long-term member of the pitching staff is now in question following his shaky late-2018 return from Tommy John surgery. Ross was ineffective in his three September starts, giving up nine runs and striking out just seven in 16 innings. On a more positive note, Ross' velocity was up from his pre-surgery levels, and his performance should improve in 2019 now that he's a year and a half removed from the procedure. That said, he will likely be ticketed for a bullpen role or open the season at Triple-A Fresno with the Nationals set to lean on veterans Anibal Sanchez and Jeremy Hellickson to round out the back end of their rotation early on.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":12.0,"33":12.0,"34":195.0,"35":281.0,"36":0.0,"37":72.0,"38":0.282352941,"39":18.0,"40":2.0,"41":1.384615384,"42":3.0,"43":0.330960854,"44":37.0,"45":34.0,"46":11.0,"47":4.732808832,"48":54.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":4.0,"54":3.0,"55":0.571428571,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":6.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":3.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":202,"statCategoryRanking":514,"statRankings":[{"forStat":41,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.010800632},{"forStat":47,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.17076892},{"forStat":48,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.7706318},{"forStat":53,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.7194885},{"forStat":57,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.24683332}],"totalRanking":856,"totalRating":-1.9185232}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":36009,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":11,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":603,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,15,16,17],"firstName":"Koda","fullName":"Koda

playing sporadically over the first four months of the season, Austin was dealt to the Twins right before the July 31 trade deadline. He was initially assigned to Triple-A Rochester before being called up on Aug. 10. Austin played fairly regularly down the stretch, recording a .782 OPS with nine homers in 136 plate appearances. Power is his game, buoyed by a career 27.6 percent HR/FB mark along with a 38.8 percent fly ball rate. However, a career 36.6 percent strikeout clip limits his ability to get to his power, though Austin did fan only 30.9 percent of the time with Minnesota. Regardless, playing time will be an issue, as C.J. Cron is slated to play first with Nelson Cruz earmarked for designated hitter. Barring an injury, Austin is looking at a reserve role.","stats":[{"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":203.0,"1":49.0,"2":0.24137931,"3":13.0,"4":0.0,"5":13.0,"6":26.0,"7":23.0,"8":101.0,"9":0.497536946,"10":18.0,"11":0.0,"12":2.0,"13":2.0,"14":3.0,"15":1.0,"16":225.0,"17":0.306666667,"18":0.804203612,"19":0.0,"20":27.0,"21":36.0,"22":0.0,"23":1.0,"24":1.0,"25":0.0,"26":4.0,"27":74.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":59.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}}]},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":33,"statCategoryRanking":246,"statRankings":[{"forStat":2,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.59704643},{"forStat":5,"ranking":0,"rating":0.85174036},{"forStat":20,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.00390858},{"forStat":21,"ranking":0,"rating":0.4970613},{"forStat":23,"ranking":0,"rating":-0.44554687}],"totalRanking":495,"totalRating":0.3022998}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"WAIVERS","tradeLocked":false,"waiverProcessDate":1552550400000},{"draftAuctionValue":0,"id":36581,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":0,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"rank":606,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Framber","fullName":"Framber

had one of the best seasons of his career in 2017 and kept things going early last season, owning a 2.10 ERA at the end of May. However, he posted a 6.53 ERA over his next 16 starts and the Nationals, after falling out of the playoff hunt, ultimately shipped him to the Brewers at the end of August. Gonzalez averaged just over 5.0 innings over five starts with the Brewers in September, but he allowed just six earned runs total and picked up three wins, playing a key role in the team's push to the postseason. Despite the quality month, Gonzalez played only a minor role for the team in October. He lost a few ticks off his fastball the past couple seasons and has never been great in the WHIP department, so in order to do much for fantasy players he is likely going to have to land with a team that gives him a shot at double-digit wins for the 10th straight

The pitch has incredible shape and defies physics on its journey to home. That pitch has been the primary driver behind efforts to hold the 243 righties he has faced to a .171 average against him over the past three seasons while striking out 31% of those hitters. He has nowhere near the same amount of success against lefties, as they have hit .250 against him and the strikeout rate is 10 percentage points lower. The Rays try to mostly utilize him as a right-handed specialist in late innings when the opponents have a streak of righty bats coming up. Sergio Romo had a similar skill set and got saves, but he also had a third pitch (changeup) to use whereas Roe has zero semblance of an off-speed pitch in his

has two distinct advantages in his quest for holds and possibly saves: He plays for a Baltimore Orioles team that is lacking in elite relief talent, and his new manager, Brandon Hyde, has already said he wants to go with a matchups approach to closing contests. Bleier is locked into the team's roster as a late-inning option, thanks to a 1.97 ERA the past two seasons combined, but he's an extreme pitch-to-contact type who gets very few strikeouts, and he's coming off lat surgery that could threaten his performance in the season's early stages.
